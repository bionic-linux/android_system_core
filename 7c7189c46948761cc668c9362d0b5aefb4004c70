      "message": "Quick question since I don\u0027t see it explicitly stated: when sync\u0027ing a new bionic, is that new bionic is used for both the boot strap bionic and the default bionic or only one of the two?  I assume both?\n\nI guess even more basic question: what happens when there\u0027s an apex module and I adb sync something in general?  I assume apex knows to no longer override that module, since it would make sense that the develop pushing a new module is specifically intending on that module to be used?",
