And my question is when a developer `adb sync`s and that overwrites the apex in the system partition, is there a way to tell APEX, \"I know you have this update in /data, but I also updated the one in /system and that\u0027s the one that you should use\"?\n\nThat\u0027s what I mean by 99% of developers won\u0027t have this situation; since we\u0027ll likely not have updated APEX modules in /data.\n\nBut more specifically, I\u0027m also wondering what happens with the bootstrap vs default bionic.  I figure if I do the following:\n\n1) Flash a device\n2) Rebuild, including changes to bionic\n3) `adb sync`\n4) Both bionics on the device have the new changes that I made\n\nIs that the case?

If it is newer than the one in /data/apex, then the that one will be used from the next reboot. If the version is lower, it will be the opposite. If the version is the same, I don\u0027t know. Dario might be able to answer.\n\n------------\nAt the step 4) where reboot hasn\u0027t been done yet, only the bootstrap Bionic is be updated (\u003dvisible to new processes). In order to apply the default Bionic in the runtime APEX, the device has to be rebooted. \n\nBTW, we could make this better; for example, apexd might restart upon adb stop/start.
