Do we need this to not be a member of the shell group for a specific reason?\n\nIn general, we don\u0027t want to make assumptions about /vendor here.  What if there is a vendor.img that already has a /vendor/bin/install-recovery.sh; we don\u0027t want to set specific permissions on it in common code.  These permissions should likely be in a config.fs file and included if the vendor is enabling install-recovery.\n\nhttps://source.android.com/devices/tech/config/filesystem for reference on config.fs.",
