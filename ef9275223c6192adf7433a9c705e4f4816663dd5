      "message": "Yes, \"slave\" is what we need here.  It\u0027s only for the purpose stated -- to make the later bind mount of /data/data onto /data/user/0 also show up at /data_mirror/data_ce/null/0.\n\nThis wasn\u0027t needed before because the bind mount of /data/data onto /data/user/0 previously happened above, in one of the lines that this CL deletes.  The mount of /data/user below is recursive, so it was picking up the mount on /data/user/0.  With this CL, the mount on /data/user/0 doesn\u0027t exist yet here, so it needs to be propagated in later.\n\nAn alternate solution would be to make vold explicitly create the mount in /data_mirror.  But it seems a bit simpler to use the slave option to make it happen automatically.",
