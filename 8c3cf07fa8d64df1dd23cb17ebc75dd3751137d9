      "message": "The creation of world writable directories has been a traditional no-no, for several reasons:\n\n1) World writable directories makes it difficult to ensure cleanup of application data on un-install.\n2) symbolic link attacks are common on world writable directories, which could further compromise the system.\n\nThese are two of the reasons why Android doesn\u0027t have something like a global /tmp directory.\n\nAdditionally, I don\u0027t see any SELinux rules allowing access to this directory, so I\u0027m not even sure how this could be usable.",
