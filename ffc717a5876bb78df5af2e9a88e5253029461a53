      "message": "You may want to do this only if the reboot command is shutdown.  I see that we do do it for reboot too currently, but that\u0027s after the below timeout which I believe is defaulted to 5 seconds.  I think it may be weird if we switch it to having a 5 second blank screen in the middle of a reboot.  The original intention is to blank before the fsck when the user is going to shutdown (and expect a blank screen) anyway.",
