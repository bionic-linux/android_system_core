      "message": "By usual socket, do you mean the socket tombstoned is listening on \u0026 crash_dump connects to?\n\nWe already have tombstoned.microdroid inside VM that listens on the usual socket. It responds to crash_dump with a fd backed by a file in guest filesystem \u0026 crash_dump writes on it. This file was later transmitted outside the VM.\n\nThe idea behind this change was to remove the tombstoned from VM, \u0026 have crash_dump write directly to virtual socket instead of writing on a guest file. The listener outside VM will then dump the data on a tombstone file in Android. This saves some precious RAM in VM (as we do not need the tombstoned/the transmitter daemon/the files which were backed by tmpfs in the VM)",
