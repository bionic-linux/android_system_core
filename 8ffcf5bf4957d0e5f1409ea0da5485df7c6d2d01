If they do, it would be better to just enable the missing ones instead of printing duplicate messages here. Also I suggested you add an error message in the secure side where if it fails to create a file. You could also enable the error message if storage_file_open fails to open/create a file, as we currently always pass STORAGE_FILE_OPEN_CREATE and that should never fail.",
