      "message": "The problem here is that it is included as part of -Weverything. That is not something that we have turned on in the platform, but if a developer enables a particular local flag, it could override what we have selected. In the case of groups of warnings (-Weverything) vs. individual warning flags, we could add something like -Wno-extra-semi to our top-level flags. We just don\u0027t spend enough time curating that list as we probably should.",
