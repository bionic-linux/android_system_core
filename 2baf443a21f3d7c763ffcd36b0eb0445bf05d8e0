      "message": "we already do: we dump the area around the PC later in the tombstone. and you already have (and only need) the PC value for *true* SIGILLs. the point of this change is for the \"bogus\" big-flip SIGILLs that don\u0027t reproduce. the hope is that you\u0027ll be able to take this and compare it to what\u0027s *supposed* to be in your .so and actually confirm your suspicion. (not foolproof, obviously, but we\u0027ll see if this is sufficient to confirm/deny our working hypothesis.)",
