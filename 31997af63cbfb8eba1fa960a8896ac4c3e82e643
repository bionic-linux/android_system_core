      "message": "Can you clarify the bug here and how it relates to b/213617178? We spent a lot of time auditing this code last year. It\u0027s quite complex but we came to the conclusion it\u0027s safe. In particular signalfd claims to compress multiple SIGCHILDs so it\u0027s necessary to reap all outstanding children.\n\nWe did want to simplify this code and replace it with pidfd this year, but I think that\u0027s unlikely to happen right now.",
