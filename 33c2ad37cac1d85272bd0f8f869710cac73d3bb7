This is a private header, but it can serve as documentation as some are confused by the nature of event logs.\n\nDemonstratively, it will serve to make sure that its existence, but _now_ non-use in android_log_event_string_t, will serve as a strong message to future selves to stay away.\n\n(I will view C++ as having a bug ;-\u003e )\n\nThere is a separate effort to create a C++ event class that may serve purpose and replace this header. For now I view it as vapourware.",
