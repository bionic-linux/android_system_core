      "message": "Possibly, but it might be bit awkward -- what happens if requests (esp. from `vold`) to use KeyMint arrive at Keystore while it\u0027s waiting?  Will we end up needing to build a queue of pending requests that get processed once KeyMint is up and running?\n\n(The same worry applies with this change -- what happens if an early `vold` request after between service-registration but before the socket is connected?)",
