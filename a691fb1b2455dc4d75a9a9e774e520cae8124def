You can not do + 1 since strrchr can return a NULL and now me will be a dereferenced NULL pointer. Please revert back. This one is \u0027fragile\u0027 because it was open-coded as we can see as you made a common mistake in refactoring it.\n\nRevert back, or take enh\u0027s suggestion to switch to the alternate char * basename(const char *path). This one is fragile because a change elsewhere, or switching includes, can cause it to switch back to the posix variant ...",
