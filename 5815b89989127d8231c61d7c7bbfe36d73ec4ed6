      "message": "Hey Jeff and Jiyong, I wasn\u0027t aware of another way to validate that we\u0027re writing to drop_caches or taking any action on user builds for a CTS test. Some others suggested looking at \"free -m\" and \"/proc/meminfo\", but I\u0027m not sure those are reliable. The only log I\u0027ve seen is from \"init: ...\" and doesn\u0027t show up on user builds.",

What if someone deletes #1146 while leaving #1147?\n\nI think having an app which mmaps a big junk file and accesses the mapped memory, and comparing [Shared|Private]_Clean fields in /proc/self/smaps before and after the drop cache operation would be a lot harder to worked around.",

      "message": "aiui you\u0027re saying that the regular init logging of _successful_ commands is missing in user builds? i wonder whether we should add something akin to the Makefile distinction between `foo` and `@foo` so a command can explicitly request that init log regardless?
