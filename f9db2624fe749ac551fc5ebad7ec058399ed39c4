I do like the LOCAL_INIT_RC idea, but I\u0027m not sure that we should delay the break up on getting that put into the build system.\n\nOn the plus side, this seems to work well on my N9.",

I\u0027d rather push these as is (or some clean up that doesn\u0027t introduce new code elsewhere) to get the break up of init done knowing that we\u0027ll need to revisit these files again for LOCAL_INIT_RC or wait till LOCAL_INIT_RC is completely ready and I\u0027m okay with waiting.",
