      "message": "I\u0027m not sure providing a default filename is the right approach here, as it makes it hard to tell what module the coverage is for. If we don\u0027t have symbols, can we just name it using the unsymbolized binary filename if that\u0027s available? This define only affects the coverage output filename. Alternatively, CoverageRecord has a constructor without a module name, but that will cause it to never write out coverage information to a file.",
