It just happened to boot the kernel because fastboot implementation lived in bootloader and kernel is the next stage.\n\nSo, by that logic, why can\u0027t we just go ahead and boot Android when fastbootd gets \u0027fastboot continue\u0027, instead of rebooting.\nThe reason for being pedantic about this is also that the reset reason changes when you reboot.\n\ncc: cfries, tbao to CMIIW.",
