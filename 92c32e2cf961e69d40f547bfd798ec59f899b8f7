      "message": "This would not be readily parseable as part of an audit record (not name\u003dvalue format).  Probably don\u0027t even need to test for !data, as that would be a bug in the caller, right?  Or if you want to allow for future selinux_check_access() calls by init that don\u0027t pass this data, then just do nothing in this case; you\u0027ll still get the regular avc message with the base fields (scontext\u003d tcontext\u003d tclass\u003d).",
