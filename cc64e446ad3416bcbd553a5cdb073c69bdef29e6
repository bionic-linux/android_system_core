      "message": "Should these be bumped up to FATAL?  If this happens during an OTA, then the bootloader should roll back to the last known safe configuration, right?  \n\nIf we continue, then the snapuserd instance from 1st stage init will continue running, right?  What is the impact there?  Will we have strange failures in the future?  Especially for development, the quicker that we realize we\u0027re in a bad configuration and bail out (assuming there\u0027s a fallback), the better.",

      "message": "I couldn\u0027t decide this at first but I think you\u0027re right, it\u0027s better to fail fast for now, at the very least for the initial tests we\u0027re doing. Indeed it would result in a rollback for OTA, but not for the merge step, so I think later on we\u0027d probably want tweak this to continue in that scenario.\n\nThe impact for leaving it running is we won\u0027t be able to make progress with the merge. At least then the device is still usable, but it won\u0027t be able to take future OTAs. If we reboot and it happens to succeed the next time, then we could in theory finish the OTA though.\n\nFor now I\u0027ve changed the ERROR to FATAL and made libsnapshot return false in a few more cases that are important.",
