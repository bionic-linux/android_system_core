If this happens during an OTA, then the bootloader should roll back to the last known safe configuration, right?  \n\nIf we continue, then the snapuserd instance from 1st stage init will continue running, right?  What is the impact there?  Will we have strange failures in the future?  Especially for development, the quicker that we realize we\u0027re in a bad configuration and bail out (assuming there\u0027s a fallback), the better.",
