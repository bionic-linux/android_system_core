      "message": "Yes I did. Unfortunately on Android pgid is often different from pid even for the main thread of the application because many/most processes are forked from zygote, so their pgid belongs to zygote. The only reliable way I found was to check if tgid\u003d\u003dpid.\nI\u0027ll see how often pgid\u003d\u003dpid for a main thread and if it\u0027s often enough I will implement an optimization to check for that first and only when they do not agree to check for tgid\u003d\u003dpid.",
