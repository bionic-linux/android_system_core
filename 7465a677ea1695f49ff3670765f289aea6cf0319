      "message": "I\u0027m new to this code, so I could be wrong, but: So before, the ReconnectAttempt would have a deadline 10 sec in the future, so it would call wait_until(10 sec) and could potentially wait 10 sec. But now this sets ReconnectAttempt to have a next_attempt of right now, so it would call wait_until(now) which would presumably return right away and then try to reconnect right away? Or maybe I\u0027m misunderstanding?",

      "message": "Correct, this was an intentional change that probably should be split off into a separate commit. My reasoning is that it probably doesn\u0027t make much sense to wait 10 seconds before trying to reconnect: the common cases for a disconnection are things along the lines of `adb root`, `adb shell killall adbd`, adbd crashing, where we want to reconnect immediately, and the network being interrupted, in which case we\u0027re probably not going to find out that the socket is dead until way later anyway.",
