      "message": "The wrapper is pretty useless, yeah. I can remove that. Good idea on `ino_t` - I think we can use it - from what I recall it resolves into an unsigned long.\n\nThere are plans to move to memfd but we haven\u0027t yet. There is a strong desire from the perf team to deduplicate native allocation registration however, hence this patch set. I realize that this means we might need to make similar changes for our memfd handling though I think it\u0027s just going to be a stat call in that case so no kernel changes would be required.\n\nThanks for the review!",
