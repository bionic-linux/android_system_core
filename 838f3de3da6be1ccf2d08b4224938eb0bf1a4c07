Doing it in the loop would deal with truncating the packet better I will agree.\n\nIn this KISS implementation, we have to ensure that the total length is limited, if the length comes from other fields other than the last one, we will reject the message as unworkable. min on this one iovec will *not* limit the overall length as per our goal.",
