Hence this fix isn\u0027t strictly speaking complete, and we might run into linker errors for APEX binaries on sanitizer builds.\n\nI think applying this as a rule of thumb makes sense though, and I hope with linkerconfig we\u0027ll solve it easily and consistently. I think it ideally should make it more effort to configure a namespace _without_ the full set of Bionic and sanitizer library links.\n\n+kiyoungkim for thoughts on that. I\u0027ve not tried to update linkerconfig correspondingly, since I don\u0027t know what approach you\u0027d prefer.",
