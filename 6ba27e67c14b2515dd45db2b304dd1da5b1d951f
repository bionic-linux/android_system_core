The reason is that the confirmationui needs to link to the correct secure input module which is currently located in the vendor/ folder as the dependency from the module in aosp to the module in vendor is not prohibited.",

We can work around that.\n\nCan\u0027t you use just use soong_namespace to get this to link a different version of secure input lib for every device? If not, we can refactor this code into a library only move main() to vendor/. \n\nPoint is that such a substantial chunk of Trusty-specific code must live in a Trusty directory.",

      "message": "It seems like I need to import the namespace of the real secure input in the Android.bp. But this causes that the build break on emulator projects on AOSP codebase since the imported path only exists in the internal repo.\n\nWhat do you think if I clone the service.cpp (the file included main() function) and the relevant .rc and .xml files to the vendor folder while other source files relevant to Trusty still can be shared? The service name needs to be different so I would like to change the service name, as the module name needs to be unique, of the emulator used as \"android.hardware.confirmationui@1.0-service.trusty_qemu\" if going this way.\n\nThen, the device specific makefile, for emulator or real target, will be chooing the right service to build.",
