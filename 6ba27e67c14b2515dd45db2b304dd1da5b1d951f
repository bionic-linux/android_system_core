The reason is that the confirmationui needs to link to the correct secure input module which is currently located in the vendor/ folder as the dependency from the module in aosp to the module in vendor is not prohibited.",

We can work around that.\n\nCan\u0027t you use just use soong_namespace to get this to link a different version of secure input lib for every device? If not, we can refactor this code into a library only move main() to vendor/. \n\nPoint is that such a substantial chunk of Trusty-specific code must live in a Trusty directory.",
