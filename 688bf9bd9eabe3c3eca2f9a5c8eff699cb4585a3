      "message": "Why not even earlier?  In theory we could/should start this right after we start hwservicemanager in late-fs.\n\nI know there are some timing concerns with qseecomd for QC devices, but we should evaluate how best to handle these.  Most of these devices wait for qseecomd in post-fs.  I\u0027d rather we did that across the board and start early_hal in late-fs, then start it in the middle of post-fs-data.",

      "message": "I acknowledge that it would be desirable to start the HALs as early as possible. But for now and given that keymaster is the only early_hal it makes a  lot of sense to start this class right here, because we can be very sure that qseecom is up, and it is in time for vold and installkey.\nIf you feel that this can be solved more holistically, than I suggest we file a bug to track this issue and then also the blocking bug against qualcomm to sort out the qseecom dependency problem. But for now this CL is probably the least intrusive solution to fixing b/35764921 and I would appreciate it if we could move forward with this.\n\nIf  early_hal is too generic a name, how about class data_hal or class hal_data_dependencies indicating that these hals are dependencies for bringing up the data partition?",
