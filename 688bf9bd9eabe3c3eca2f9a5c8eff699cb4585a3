In theory we could/should start this right after we start hwservicemanager in late-fs.\n\nI know there are some timing concerns with qseecomd for QC devices, but we should evaluate how best to handle these.  Most of these devices wait for qseecomd in post-fs.  I\u0027d rather we did that across the board and start early_hal in late-fs, then start it in the middle of post-fs-data.",
