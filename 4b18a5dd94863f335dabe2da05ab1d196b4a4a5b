That\u0027s how we format them for system/core (and most the rest of Android too), e.g. something like:\n\nUse mem cgroups in libprocessgroup if they\u0027re available\n\nUse mem cgroups if the kernel is built with CONFIG_MEMCG\u003dy, etc etc\n\n(gerrit\u0027s comments don\u0027t render the newline as full sized but there\u0027s one between those two lines)",
