A few BPF maps would be created with uprobestats as the owner.\n3. init.rc would create a config directory with uprobestats as the owner. (this is already included in this change)\n\nDid you mean that you\u0027d like to have 1 and/or 2 included in this same change? I can add 1. uprobestats.rc. The BPF maps won\u0027t be ready for review in a while and I am hoping to get the other parts of the project checked in first.",
