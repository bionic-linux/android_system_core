      "message": "Currently, the init language supports a \"start\" directive, for starting a defined service. So this would be a replacement for declaring a service and then someone starting it, right?\n\nIf so, when would we recommend that someone use this \"exec\" vs just creating a one-shot service which does the same thing? I want to make sure we\u0027re not introducing unnecessary complexity here.",

      "message": "maybe exec should be start but with with arguments? sometimes it is convenient to be able to do e.g. \"exec rm -rf /path/to/whatever\" for a few different paths, but declaring a specific service for each is a bit annoying.",

      "message": "i think ghartman is saying the opposite of what i think nnk understood: that as long as this is just equivalent to an anonymous one-shot service, it\u0027s not very useful. he needs it to block init from moving forward and running anything else until the child exits. so when this is something worth checking in, it\u0027ll be more obviously distinct from one-shot services. (though it might be worth explicitly calling out the relationship and differences in the documentation.)\n\nwe should definitely talk to the sony guys next week, since they seem to have some experience with using exec, and my aim is to get something that everyone can use.\n\n(and, yes, we should move the property startup earlier in init so that an exec\u0027ed binary can set properties earlier than they can with this change. i was going to do that as a separate patch though.)",
