      "message": "If I\u0027m reading this the right way, exec is a short-hand way of specifying an anonymous one-shot service. The child is asynchronous, so we\u0027d still have to use execonce for tasks like building the fstab and getting the display resolution.",

      "message": "Currently, the init language supports a \"start\" directive, for starting a defined service. So this would be a replacement for declaring a service and then someone starting it, right?\n\nIf so, when would we recommend that someone use this \"exec\" vs just creating a one-shot service which does the same thing? I want to make sure we\u0027re not introducing unnecessary complexity here.",
