(it\u0027s inherently confusing that there are *three* parts to adb.)\n\nif we were comfortable insisting that if plugdev exists, adb must be in it, we could move this check into [whichever is the appropriate] main and just never start a client/server in that case.\n\nor we can try this and see whether folks are still confused. this is definitely a step in the right direction.",
