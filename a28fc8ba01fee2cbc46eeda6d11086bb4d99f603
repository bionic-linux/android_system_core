      "message": "Hmm, good fix, I don\u0027t know why I didn\u0027t do this in the first place. The one weirdness is that if errno is set here, _fh_socket_close() returns 0 and adb_close() ignores that and returns 0 itself. So adb_close() is \"wrong\" in the sense that it may set errno even when 0 is returned.\n\nBut this is very, very corner case and in practice probably pointless, so I\u0027ll leave it up to you to ignore this or open a bug, etc.",
