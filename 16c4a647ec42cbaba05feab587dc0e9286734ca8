      "message": "You can probably drop this check.  It\u0027s important to ueventd, since for historical reasons, ueventd is built into the same executable as init and therefore can literally access init\u0027s globals, which would have no meaning for it.\n\nHere, since you\u0027re not linking to init.cpp, you\u0027d get an error at linking if you tried to use these symbols, so this check isn\u0027t needed.",
