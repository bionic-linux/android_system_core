      "message": "apparently adding junk to the end of ELF file is safe...\n\nI\u0027ve dug through the change history. Looks like during Android P/Q there are special mount settings for bootstrap/libc.so (which bind mounts to /bionic or whatever crazy stuff), so this test was actually also testing /bionic mountpoints.\n(@jiyong this test case) \nI think the /bionic mount stuff is no longer relevant, even for upgrading devices? \nBut this test still tests overlay file modification, so it\u0027s still doing something, it\u0027s just that we no longer _have_ to modify libc.so.\n\nMaybe we could modify this test to modify something more harmless, like appending comments to build.prop and whatnot",
