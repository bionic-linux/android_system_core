      "message": "apparently adding junk to the end of ELF file is safe...\n\nI\u0027ve dug through the change history. Looks like during Android P/Q there are special mount settings for bootstrap/libc.so (which bind mounts to /bionic or whatever crazy stuff), so this test was actually also testing /bionic mountpoints.\n(@jiyong this test case) \nI think the /bionic mount stuff is no longer relevant, even for upgrading devices? \nBut this test still tests overlay file modification, so it\u0027s still doing something, it\u0027s just that we no longer _have_ to modify libc.so.\n\nMaybe we could modify this test to modify something more harmless, like appending comments to build.prop and whatnot",

      "message": "Okay thanks for the explanation. Yeah I was just mildly shocked that this worked. I was afraid the garbage string was actually some kind of special byte sequence. If so it\u0027d be better to do build.prop or something more amenable to modifications. But if it really is random, and the sequence will work equally well across different ABIs, it seems fine as-is.
