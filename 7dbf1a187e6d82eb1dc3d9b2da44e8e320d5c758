      "message": "This is basically requesting that we listen on the uevent socket for these files to be created rather than polling on them?\n\nWhat are the file paths that we\u0027re waiting on?  They\u0027re the /dev/... paths, right?  We won\u0027t get uevent notifications for those, only their underlying /sys/... entries, so we\u0027d still need to poll between the point of getting the /sys/... uevent and when the file exists.\n\nAre there any efficient ways to wait on a file on a tmpfs or is polling the only option?",
