      "message": "I was about to talk ri tiy exactly the same thing, an overlay instead of fork the whole file. Potential issue I think is vendor kernel setting CONFIG_RT_GROUP_SCHED. Hopefully those RT value we put could workaround, but it is best we let vendor clean that out. Another one is CONFIG_FAIR_GROUP_SCHED, the new cpuctl hierarchy would cause a subtle difference on fairness of tasks, but that only happens in very heavy load in some of the groups. \n\nOverall I prefer this approach which is cleaner and less error prone.",
