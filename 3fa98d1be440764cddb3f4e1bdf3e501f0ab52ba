I wouldn\u0027t support those code paths at all; in either set up, teardown, or mount.  It should simplify this lots.",

      "message": "NB: there is a considered use case for /data to permit large scale development for frameworks. This use case has not been eliminated from the plan, but has been relegated to nice-to-have rather than required. As such it is continuing to be developed in the context of my privaste branch, but is not visible in the set of CLs.\n\nNB: some thoughts were to bind-mount /data/overlay to /mnt/scratch/overlay, or land a symbolic link in /mnt/scratch(not mounted)/overlay to /data/overlay as an alternative to direct /data support.\n\nThis patch was conceived as _not_ about logical, it is about /mnt/scratch, so it deals generically with the possibility that _both_ exist. What you are really asking for is to merge portions of this into the Dynamic /mnt/scratch CL that depends on this which has the orthogonal contract you speak of; and defer the \u0027tabular + loop + logic\u0027 handling to the /data CL. Can do, logic deferred.\n\nDo not be surprised if this CL turns into \u0027create fs_mgr_overlayfs_teardown_one\u0027 ...",
