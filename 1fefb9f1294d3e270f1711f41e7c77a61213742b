      "message": "Hmmmm. I took a quick look at the change. I have a feeling the constants up to line 30 will no longer be necessary if that change is updated to use the new API that abstracts this away.\n\nOnce those other changes go in, I will look and see how things can be refactored, so constants don\u0027t end up being defined twice.",

I think introducing macros should be avoided if possible, since they are currently not being used and would break the namespace stuff.\n\nThe constants on line 37 and 38 are already defined as static consts and used internally.",
