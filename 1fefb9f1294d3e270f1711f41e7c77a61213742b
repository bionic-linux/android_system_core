I have a feeling the constants up to line 30 will no longer be necessary if that change is updated to use the new API that abstracts this away.\n\nOnce those other changes go in, I will look and see how things can be refactored, so constants don\u0027t end up being defined twice.",

That\u0027s part of why I like this being moved into a common header, since both the host side (your change) and the device side (that change) can share the same strings for the protocol.",
