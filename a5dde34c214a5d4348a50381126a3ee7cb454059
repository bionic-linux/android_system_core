The measurement was made on Pixel 6. Sorry, the link is not accessible to the public, but here\u0027s the summary.\n\n* Zygote64Timing_ZygoteInit-mean: increase by ~100ms\n* bootloader_time-mean: decreased by ~15ms // irrelevant\n* TOTAL_BOOT_TIME-mean: decreased by ~150ms\n* init_bootanim_DURATION-mean: decreased by ~100ms\n* SystemServerTiming_StartServices-mean: decreased by ~110ms\n* SystemServerTiming_PhaseActivityManagerReady-mean: decreased by ~40ms\n\nI see ~100ms of decrease, but they seem to be within the variance.\n\n[1] https://crystalball-presubmit.corp.google.com/dashboard/I83700010278618426?host\u003dandroid-review.googlesource.com\u0026change_number\u003d3094957\u0026patchset\u003d1\u0026omit_non_regressed_metrics\u003dFalse\u0026blocking_only\u003dTrue",
