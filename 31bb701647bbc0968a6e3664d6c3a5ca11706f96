      "message": "TL;DR: yes.\n\nwhat might have confused you is that if you use a duration as an adjective (as in \"a 4 second delay\" or \"a 12 second timeout\", say), then it\u0027s all just singular. it gets weirder if you spell the fractions out rather than use a decimal point; so \"0.25 seconds\" but \"quarter _of a_ second\" or \"0.5 seconds\" but \"half _a_ second\"!\n\nnot that it will be much consolation to you coming (i assume, given your name) from a language that doesn\u0027t really bother marking plurals at all most of the time, but there are plenty of languages with _more_ complex rules than english for this stuff... see external/icu/icu4c/source/data/misc/plurals.txt for the full nightmare :-)\n\ntbh, there\u0027s a lot to be said for a format like \"0m3s\" or whatever; ugly but unambiguous and easy to code. (whereas i\u0027d argue that things like uptime fail the \"unambiguous\" test when they say something like \"00:30\" --- is the smallest unit seconds or minutes?)",
