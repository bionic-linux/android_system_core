      "message": "yeah, i was going to try to keep this in sysdeps_win32.cpp, but when i looked more closely i realized it wasn\u0027t just used for the _win32_lock, it\u0027s for *all* the adb mutexes. when we bump the minimum supported version to vista in a week or two, we should be able to fix libc++\u0027s std::mutex and then just delete all this crap. but i agree this is probably the least worst choice in the meantime...",
