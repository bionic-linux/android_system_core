      "message": "I have some issue with this and two commented lines above. Then ServiceList::GetInstance().FindServicesByApexName is called within reboot_test.cpp, the service list only has 1 service, which was added in this test.\nWhen I tried to ctl.apex_unload, ServiceList::GetInstance().FindServicesByApexName is called from init. The service list has over 140 services and the test service is not on the list. \nServieList::GetInstance() return the singleton service list. I am not sure where the difference came from.\nBelow are logcat from two test runs: one called ServiceList::GetInstance().FindServicesByApexName within reboot_test.cpp and one called ServiceList::GetInstance().FindServicesByApexName from init.\nhttps://paste.googleplex.com/5739972532371456\nhttps://paste.googleplex.com/5021881649332224",
