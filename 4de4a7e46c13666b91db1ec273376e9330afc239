      "message": "I was having trouble implementing everything else on top of this patch, so I redid it with a new abstraction, ISnapshotWriter, which extends ICowWriter. OnlineKernelSnapshotWriter now supports AddCopy(). In addition, ISnapshotWriter handles conversion to FileDescriptors now. This should be cleaner since (1) opening a writer was necessary anyway, and (2) the writer has all the state needed to open for reading, whereas SnapshotManager would have to recover it all.",
