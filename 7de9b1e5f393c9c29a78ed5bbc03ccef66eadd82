      "message": "Yes it has to be added as this file is not exposed anywhere except \"liblp_test_defaults\" which cannot be used directly in the fuzzer\u0027s cc_fuzz. Reason for the same is that \"libcrypto_static\" is not visible to our fuzzer. Also this file is used by fuzzers in subsequent CLs in \"fs_mgr/liblp/fuzzer/Android.bp\" but this file is in \"fs_mgr/liblp/\" and hence can\u0027t be included directly. Hence, to overcome all this, we need this filegroup.",
