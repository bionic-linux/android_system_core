      "message": "We can put as many fprintfs and GTEST_LOG_(INFO) messages as we desire into a gTest to help diagnose failures when they happen, or to identify issues. None trigger a failure to go/apct or result, but no way I am removing this message because it is a want-to-know.\n\nOr do you disagree that the info message is formatted in a similar manner as the EXPECT_TRUE failure messages. I did so because multiple failures will show _which_ ones are missing when one digs into the report, and making radio different/short-and-sweet than the others actually made it less visible.",

If we don\u0027t really care that radio_logs is NULL, then why print the message.\n\nIf you think this really is likely to be useful, then I\u0027m ok with it, I just think in practice these sorts of low-signal messages are useless in a test output of 1000\u0027s of lines.",
