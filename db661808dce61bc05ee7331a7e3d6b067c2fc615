      "message": "Do we want to deprecate writepid to set cpuset? I do not see it being used _anywhere_ for cgroup?\n\nI do not like there are two competing interfaces with overlapping interference, this only leads to confusion. writepid to /dev/cpuset/ and at times /dev/stune/ is used predominantly (except external/wpa_supplicant_8/hostapd/hostapd.android.rc).\n\nGiving too many choices is bad engineering. writepid has it\u0027s place (at least in one place), dropping this highlighted sentence would be the appearance that it does not present a choice for cpuset. Followed by a complete replacement of all uses of writepid in the tree to use cpuset, _then_ you have the shining example.\n\nI do not feel comfortable accepting this change without the interlocking set of changes that represents the more meaningful(?) way of doing this all.",

Correct me if I am wrong.\n\nI know the above sentence is a reversal of the suggestions above by hinting that cpuset keyword not be added, but it represents good engineering that we keep one choice.",
