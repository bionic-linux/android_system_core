The platform bus being higher in the device\u0027s tree, must always get probed first if this is the case and you would always receive the platform uevent before you get the block uevent if the block device indeed is a platform device ...\n\ne.g. on sailfish you should receive events in the order for vendor_a (sda31)\n\nplatform (bus)-\u003escsi(bus)-\u003e..scsi_host events..-\u003eblock(dev, sda31, partition)\n\nThe only way this would happen is if we changed uevent context (i.e. if we are listening to uevents w/o going through coldboot first, which means we never kept a list of platform devices)",
