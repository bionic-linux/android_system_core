      "message": "Thank you for bringing up the chromimum. I was going to ask the same on android-webview-dev@chromium.org because I see the following ashmem error with memfd before org.chromium.webview_shell crash dump in logcat:\n\nE chromium: [ERROR:platform_shared_memory_region_android.cc(190)] Ashmem region has a wrong protection mask: it is not read-only but it should be\n\nI\u0027m using stock AOSP/external/chromium-webview/ prebuilts and I wonder if the upstream webview/chromium has moved on to memfd or do they still depend on ashmem.",
