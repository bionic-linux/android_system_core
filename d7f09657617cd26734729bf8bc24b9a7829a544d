      "message": "Possible to also remove `ImageManager::MapImageWithDeviceMapper()` entirely now that `MapImageDevice()` no longer supports the non-dm path?\n\n\u003e we can recommend they make WrapUserdataIfNeeded() unconditional\n\nWhat are the downsides of always wrapping userdata, even if the underlying block device has 0 holders? Sounds like that way we could remove loop mapping code without breaking any functionality on devices that for whatever reason[*] don\u0027t have metadata encryption enabled.\n\n[*] Perhaps just haven\u0027t enabled it yet during early bringup stages?",
