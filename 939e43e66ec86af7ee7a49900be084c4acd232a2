(that\u0027s actually why i was looking at this code --- wonder what parts of it we could replace with modern C/C++ instead without too much trouble. sadly, since libutils isn\u0027t hurting us -- we don\u0027t use it -- and there are far too many things that are hurting us, i doubt i\u0027ll make any dent in it.)",
