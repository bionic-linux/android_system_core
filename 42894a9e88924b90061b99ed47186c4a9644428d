      "message": "i\u0027m a little worried about what this will do for devices that don\u0027t support all the partitions erased by fastboot -w (e.g. will cause scripts for those devices to start failing because). Additionally, doesn\u0027t this mean that \u0027fastboot erase userdata\u0027 will do more than \u0027fastboot format userdata\u0027.\n\nWhat do you think of printing a big warning instead suggesting use of \u0027fastboot -w\u0027? I think there is definitely room for improvement here though to allow users to explicitly trigger the device\u0027s factory reset functionality through a fastboot command (e.g. \u0027fastboot factory-reset\u0027)",
