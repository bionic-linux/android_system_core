      "message": "This is a bit confusing, I thought that we didn\u0027t expect CTS built on Android X, to pass on Android X - 1.\n\nFrom the bug, I think they are doing something that\u0027s not valid. For example, bionic tests don\u0027t generally pass on previous versions of Android. It might work, but there is no guarantee it would and those are part of CTS.",

      "message": "They\u0027re running R CTS with an R system image and Q vendor image, which I is supposed to pass.\n\nThis fails since init changed this behavior in R but keeps the previous behavior for vendor images launched before R.  This change tests the new behavior only for vendor images launched at R or later, matching the init behavior.",
