      "message": "I know our official stance is not to support alternate byte orders anymore on Android; but if you remove this, then you have triggered the technical debt to remove all the code in the logger that has been religiously put in place to support alternate byte orders.\n\nAnd to add FUD to the removal ... the logger has been put in place on non-android embedded platforms, liblogd was created to support them, that use logd so constructed to push content over peripheral links. I have not received a clear answer that _all_ peripherals that want to leverage the logger will be LE yet.",

      "message": "this code has never been tested because there\u0027s no big-endian hardware for anyone to test it on, and hasn\u0027t been since around the time the berlin wall fell. it\u0027s almost certainly wrong, and it\u0027s distracting noise at best.\n\nactively removing anything relating to big-endian is good for all of us because it helps _prevent_ any future bad hardware decisions incurring needless costs on us. it\u0027s a _good_ thing to make it harder to support big-endian than it is to just switch whichever chip someone wants to use over into its little-endian mode. (since the 68000 ceased production around the time the berlin wall fell, i don\u0027t think there\u0027s a big-endian-only processor in production. all the \"big-endian\" processors remaining are actually bi. we may as well code to benefit processors with separate data and address registers as worry about big-endian...)",
