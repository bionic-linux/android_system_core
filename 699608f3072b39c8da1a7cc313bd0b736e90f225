      "message": "Isn\u0027t there a risk of msgbuf not being terminated? Reading all the way to MSGBUFSIZE seems to risk overwriting the implicit init done, or does the kernel always null-terminate the buffer, even if it is larger than MSGBUFSIZE?\n\nI guess the worst case scenario is puts going off on a tangent, so probably not particularly dangerous, but still?",
