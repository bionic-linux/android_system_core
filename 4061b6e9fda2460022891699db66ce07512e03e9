If so, then you only need to change the `errno \u003d\u003d ENOENT` case, however your change also affects the cases when `errno !\u003d ENOENT`. For that case, before the change we would do:\n```\nPLOG(WARNING) \u003c\u003c __func__ \u003c\u003c \" failed to open process cgroup uid \"\n              \u003c\u003c uid \u003c\u003c \" pid \" \u003c\u003c initialPid;\nreturn -1;\n```\nbut now we will be unnecessarily sending SIGKILLS and returning 0, won\u0027t we?",
