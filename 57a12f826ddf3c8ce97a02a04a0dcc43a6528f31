      "message": "that [should be] because they have to run before the system partition is available (and thus no /system/lib and thus no shared libraries [also no /system/bin, so no dynamic linker either!]). but your executable can\u0027t do its job until both /system and /data are available anyway. plus you didn\u0027t use LOCAL_FORCE_STATIC_EXECUTABLE so you were still reliant on /system/bin. in which case...\n\n(this is a problem. there are definitely things that are bloated with static libraries just because the makefile they copy \u0026 pasted happened to be doing that. and then they grow a shared library dependency that brings in another copy of a library they statically linked, and things start going subtly wrong at runtime. if you can\u0027t explain why something _must_ be static, make it shared.)",
