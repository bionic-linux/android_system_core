      "message": "Could we modify this when initially growing the partitions to make it that \u0027sectors\u0027 is always aligned?  We would overallocate the extents originally, but since it\u0027s otherwise unusable space, that shouldn\u0027t be an issue, right?  Then we wouldn\u0027t need this additional logic during resizing, and if I\u0027m guessing right, the logic to overallocate would be simpler?",
