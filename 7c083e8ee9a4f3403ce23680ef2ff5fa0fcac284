      "message": "In reality we only (should) get here if there is no overlayfs presence on the device, system as root. The fs_mgr_update_logical_partition should never be called, but was added for _completeness_. And to that point, maybe should be removed as it is not a supported configuration.\n\nLine 349 I notice makes no sense, I need to clean it up or document why it is there.\n\nTested only on taimen so far. I am still waiting for checks on a retrofit device (the build is not going to finish before my EOD) just in case it affects these paths.",
