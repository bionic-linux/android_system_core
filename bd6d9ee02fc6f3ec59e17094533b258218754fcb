      "message": "Internally it would be nice if we supported a \"reinit\" that only changed the filter if persist.logd.filter changed. The algorithm is more complicated than the corner case deserves since reinit is controlled by our init task and typically happens at 3 seconds into boot, and after the /data filesystem mounts. A person doing \u0027restart logd-reinit\u0027 will cause any runtime changes (logcat -P) to be erased; we accept that.",
