      "message": "We need to discuss about zone-based approach. Zone is just software concept for allocation constraint. Especially, zone-\u003e[high|low|min] is just proportional share of global min_free_kbytes. IOW, if one of zones in a node is lack of free memory, that doesn\u0027t mean system is under memory pressure. Rather than relying on the zone-watermark, Can\u0027t set up our wattermark based on min_free_kbytes and watermark_scacle_factor?",
