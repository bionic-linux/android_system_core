I would prefer to place the name for the first one, and if it is already set, put a null string instead (none NULL pointer) so that we get _one_ message. Would that be OK?\n\nI am hating how complicated this loop is getting, and the associated error tracking.\n\nI expect only _one_ will give us problems, or _all_, but the good news is that even if more than one, as it stands now we still report an error code back to the caller (scripts) and _one_ error message.\n\nIf this really bothers you, then I need to create logcat_error handler for the loops above ... then exit an error code here. What I did not like about that was that we would report several lines (6 if -b all) of error messages all saying the same thing except for the log buffer reference.\n\nThe user is a script, I expect it does not care _which_ buffer failed. A user would consider 6 lines of dump bad behavior, so one message if at all possible.",
