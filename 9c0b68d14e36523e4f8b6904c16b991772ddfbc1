      "message": "Thanks Elliott.\n\nYou\u0027re right, I missed that ioctl was also taking \"int\", even if some ioctls are larger than INT_MAX.  We can pass a negative number to toolbox to get around it.\n\nMaybe there\u0027s no bug here.",

      "message": "well, if it\u0027s awkward to use in practice that\u0027s still a bug. if people are used to dealing with 0x87654321 it\u0027s a pain in the ass if they need to translate that to a negative number.\n\nmaybe ll (so people have the choice) and then range check ourselves? (since right now you can type \"ioctl /dev/whatever crap\" and it\u0027ll do _something_, ignoring the fact that you didn\u0027t supply a number at all.)",
