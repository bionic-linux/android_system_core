      "message": "The motivation of putting here is hiding this file from applications, not for granting access to system servers.\nIf we have other way of doing it in the higher layer, please let me know. I\u0027m happy to use it instead.\n\nBackground:\nBecause of the historical reasons, /system/etc/fonts.xml has been accessed from apps, so we cannot change the XML syntax for the backward compatibility even if we have a public APIs of accessing system installed font information. To be able to add new feature, we decided to deprecate /system/etc/fonts.xml and add new XML file which is /system/etc/font_fallback.xml (currently it is just a copy of fonts.xml). We keep fonts.xml for backward compatibility but it would be a subset of the new XML in near future. Not to this XML be another fonts.xml, we want to hide it from application process and encourage developers to use the public APIs.",
