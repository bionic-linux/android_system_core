      "message": "I\u0027m a little hazy on my understanding of shell expressions and variable represenation in the shell, but I made this change based on this part of the mksh man page (http://linux.die.net/man/1/mksh):\n\n---\n\nExpressions are calculated using signed arithmetic and the mksh_ari_t type (a 32-bit signed integer), unless they begin with a sole \u0027#\u0027 character, in which case they use mksh_uari_t (\na 32-bit unsigned integer).\n\n---\n\nIt was my understanding that when ${random} gets set, it would be set as a string as the output of the `od` call (and thus signed vs unsigned doesn\u0027t matter to this variable), and the `od` call would return a 32 bit unsigned int as a string.  Then for the arithmetic expression, the leading # character would tell the shell to use an unsigned int, and thus convert the input string value using all 32 unsigned bits.\n\nHere\u0027s my local test I ran in the emulator, which unless my initial number for a max unsigned int is incorrect (which var1 suggests it isn\u0027t), should include setting the high bit:\n\n# local random\u003d4294967295                                                            \n\n# echo $random                                                                 \n\n4294967295\n\n# local var1\u003d$((random))\n\n# echo $var1\n\n-1\n\n# local var2\u003d$((#random))\n\n# echo $var2\n\n4294967295",
