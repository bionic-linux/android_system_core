      "message": "Which process other than ueventd need this? ueventd is a special process, so I think hardcoding something about it is not bad at all.\n\nIMO, this looks like an over-abstraction. What if someone (in Google or in partners) accidentally or intentionally use this? How can we ensure that the use of this option doesn\u0027t cause a problem especially given that we also have `namespace mnt`?\n\nI wish we could deprecate `namespace mnt` option because nobody used it. But recently the new camera HAL started to use it for the reason which I believe is unnecessary. Nevertheless, from now on, it\u0027s extremely difficult to remove the option because we know that there\u0027s at least a user. The same applies to this one. We need to be careful when adding a knob.",
