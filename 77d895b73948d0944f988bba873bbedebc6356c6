      "message": "Maybe a nicer way to disable this would be to produce a warning and continue running until it is fixed, instead of a fatal error. That would also have the advantage that the IsFilePinned() function doesn\u0027t need to alse be #if 0\u0027d out, presumably because it is static but not being called from this file.\n\nThe error message ought to be that the file was not pinned properly, it is not clear that a write failed, at least not from within this function.\n\nAnyhow because this is work in progress, #if 0-ing it out is good too.",

      "message": "Yes, a warning would have been nice. However, the thing is, if the file is not pinned, then its not a \"warning\", its \"Fatal\", because we may be corrupting the filesystem by doing direct block writes. So, It had to be fatal.\nIt works \"by chance\" right now.",

      "message": "Sandeep, my whole life I\u0027ve put \"new\" on the \"left\" and \"old\" on the \"right\" of side-by-side diffs. Gerrit doesn\u0027t put on top which is \"old\" and which is \"new\" (there is no heading) it just has an empty line above this side-by-side GUI with a heading \"File\" and doesn\u0027t identify which is which. To top it off it puts the comment box under the \"old\" column (the \"left\" side), so I obviously read your change completely the wrong way (thought \"old\" was \"new\" and vice-versa).\n\nI am sorry about that. Will have to re-train my brain, I guess \"red\" which I see on the left only must mean what was removed and \"green\" which I see on the right must mean what was added.\n\nAnyhow apart from feeling silly, I\u0027ll attribute it to not being used to web-based tools, I\u0027ll try to not use the side-by-side diff, in the unified diff its all green-or-red, but no \u0027+\u0027 or \u0027-\u0027 :-( so I\u0027ll have to be getting used to this coloring scheme (something else I\u0027ve never used before, more of a black-and-white person).\n\nSo please ignore my comment, and apologies again.",
