      "message": "that\u0027s the other alternative, but because you *do* get those from bionic\u0027s \u003cendian.h\u003e, that would mean that this file would fail in its purpose of providing \"one header for all the endian stuff\".\n\nthe disadvantage is that it means you get a few random networking structs added too. if that turns out to be a problem, we can worry about it then.",
