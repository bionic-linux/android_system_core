Restricting it to what\u0027s currently used doesn\u0027t seem downstream-developer-friendly. I could also make the point that anyone concerned with that level of bloat should probably be building their own stripped-down components instead (much like old LLVM\u0027s on the Android device).\n\n\u003e \n\u003e Maybe one idea would be to make the list of projects linked into libLLVM.so configurable? So the default would just be llvm but you could also have it be llvm + clang + clang-tools-extra (or just llvm + clang if you don\u0027t care about the tools). Then the in-tree tools in your selected projects would dynamically link against libLLVM instead of being statically linked, and you could dynamically link against it from out of tree as well.\n\u003e \n\u003e It looks like there\u0027s something like that already with LLVM_DYLIB_COMPONENTS but that only covers LLVM components.\n\nPerhaps. It might be interesting to see what other upstream folks (especially those with other downstream tools) think about providing broader functionality. It\u0027s weird to me that we can\u0027t make the case for \"`llvm-symbolizer` and other utilities should be able to be built dynamically linked to reduce total size\".\n\n\u003e \n\u003e \u003e https://android.googlesource.com/platform/prebuilts/clang-tools/ is indeed where they live as prebuilts (both darwin and linux versions of the tools, although perhaps the darwin ones are obsolete now.\n\u003e \n\u003e I was more asking *why* they are prebuilts. If we can have them be built from source like the other host tools then I think that would simplify how they are developed.\n\nThey are prebuilts because the Clang/LLVM C++ APIs they depend on are unstable. If we had to build these as part of the platform, that means \"we\" (toolchain folks) are now responsible for updating everyone else\u0027s downstream tool sources (many of which have no tests). By decoupling the toolchain they build against, we can ensure that the platform toolchain (and NDK toolchain, and kernel toolchain, ...) can keep flowing along without other teams serving as an unnecessary blocker.",

I could also make the point that anyone concerned with that level of bloat should probably be building their own stripped-down components instead (much like old LLVM\u0027s on the Android device).\n\nI agree that the default should be to provide everything in the project\u0027s lib directory if you\u0027ve opted to include that project in libLLVM. We can let developers contribute more customizations if they want.\n\n\u003e Perhaps. It might be interesting to see what other upstream folks (especially those with other downstream tools) think about providing broader functionality. It\u0027s weird to me that we can\u0027t make the case for \" llvm-symbolizer  and other utilities should be able to be built dynamically linked to reduce total size\".\n\nIt looks like it\u0027s possible to dynamically link the utilities that only use LLVM libraries against libLLVM.so by using LLVM_LINK_DYLIB, but this doesn\u0027t affect Clang tools as far as I\u0027m aware. It would be good to have an upstream solution for shipping both LLVM and Clang tools without shipping duplicate code. One upstream solution that\u0027s being worked on is a \"busybox\" for the LLVM tools (https://reviews.llvm.org/D109977) but this appears to only cover LLVM and not Clang or out-of-tree tools.\n\n\u003e They are prebuilts because the Clang/LLVM C++ APIs they depend on are unstable.

By decoupling the toolchain they build against, we can ensure that the platform toolchain (and NDK toolchain, and kernel toolchain, ...) can keep flowing along without other teams serving as an unnecessary blocker.\n\nRight, I thought it was something like that. But can\u0027t it be solved by making the toolchain version number independent of the tools version number, as I mentioned previously? The idea would be that when you upgrade the toolchain used to build the platform from version X to version Y by changing the value of ClangDefaultVersion in build/soong/cc/config/global.go, the tools would continue to link against version X because that version number would be specified in some other variable (similar to bindgenClangVersion in build/soong/rust/bindgen.go). And updating that to version Y can be done by a separate team independently of the toolchain upgrade.",
