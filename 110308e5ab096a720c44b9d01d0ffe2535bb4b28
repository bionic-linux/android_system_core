Or only to mount points we know that have _no_ parent mount.",

      "message": "There is a more detailed example in I6cdbe8c52d826a6f03fd363c909ebb0005446b96\n\nThe problem happens when the remount order is inverted. If the user first remount /product and then /product/app then it\u0027s fine.\n\nIf the user first remount /product/app and then /product, then it would be problematic because:\n\n1. After remounting /product/app, an overlayfs would override the original /product/app mountpoint. so there would be two filesystems mounted on /producr/app, the first one is the original mount (A), the second is the overlayfs (B). The parent mount of the overlayfs mount (B) is the original mount (A).\n2. When remounting /product, the remount procedure would want to move mount /product/app (B). If the original mount (A), which is the parent of (B), is not MS_PRIVATE, then moving (B) would fail.\n\nHope this clears things up... I understand that it\u0027s very difficult to comprehend.\n\n\n\u003e If reboot is needed to ensure a clean environment after initial overlayfs setup, can we avoid mounting the overlay until reboot like with avb enabled?\n\nI\u0027ll consider it.",
