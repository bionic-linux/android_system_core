In the \"resize partition\" loop we can move this check and add a delete task. My question would be if we delete a partition, do we still want to resize it? or would that fail",

But Pixel 3 has a physical \"system_b\" partition, so the is_logical() check will fail, and we\u0027ll skip the resize. So deleting is okay.\n\nHaving delete tasks sounds good.",
