      "message": "I personally think the cleanest fix is to move the restorecon (L894 in PS3) up a few lines. My main worry is that things that run earlier depend on that restorecon to apply the correct label; in particular, if we moved restorecon up, this would then run *after* the restorecon, so we have to make sure apexd-snapshotde doesn\u0027t depend on the restorecon:\n\n    # Allow apexd to snapshot and restore device encrypted apex data in the case\n    # of a rollback. This should be done immediately after DE_user data keys\n    # are loaded. APEXes should not access this data until this has been\n    # completed and apexd.status becomes \"ready\".\n    exec_start apexd-snapshotde\n\nadded Nikita and Oli for that.",
