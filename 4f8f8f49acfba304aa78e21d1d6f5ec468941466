      "message": "data now represents what is passed exactly to the logcat command by logcatd.rc and thus is also _more_ _correct_ for propagation to the grep command. logcat uses similar rules to split out the directory and file portion of the path, thus my preference to ensure they are aligned.\n\nIn the past, I have tested the performance of the shell with the % and # operators and could not measure their effect; so this is not a burden from that perspective.",
