      "message": "Adding OWNERS +1 since I think there is some value in fuzzing MetadataBuilder -\u003e FlashPartitionTable, but it\u0027s pretty limited. These functions are not attack vectors so best case we\u0027ll expose something wrong in the OTA process.\n\nI think a more interesting target would be ReadFromImageFile or ReadFromImageBlob. They might be a bit hard to fuzz since part of the image format is a checksum. But errors in our deserialization code would be more concerning.",
