      "message": "why is this arm_arm64? i was expecting \"arm\" or \"arm32\" vs \"arm64\"? what does \"arm_arm64\" mean? (in particular --- will this work for Go/TV/Wear, which are the only things still using arm32, and are 32-_only_ rather than 32/64?)\n\nwhich also makes me wonder why we don\u0027t have x86/x86-64/riscv64 ... is the intent here to just have \"a representative 32-bit abi\" and \"a representative 64-bit abi\" rather than actually all the supported abis? is that a good idea? (it certainly wasn\u0027t for bionic --- many of the historical abi mistakes there were because folks weren\u0027t paying attention to all the abis. though, yes, the 32 vs 64 split was the _biggest_ cause of mistakes. but we definitely had intel vs arm too. riscv64 mistakes haven\u0027t been possible yet :-) )",
