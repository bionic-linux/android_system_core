The length passed to backed_block_split isn\u0027t accounting for the chunk header, so it either has to be included here or in the split calculation below.  I suggest leaving the overhead as-is.",

      "message": "This new algorithm takes the beginning skip chunk into account.  Yes, backed_block_split does not account the chunk header but I thought it would be already accounted because we already wrote the current backed block.  I forgot that \"count\" is not used in if (file_len + count \u003e len) { ... } calculation.",
