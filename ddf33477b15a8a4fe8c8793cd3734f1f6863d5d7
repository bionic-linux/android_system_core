      "message": "\u003e Could make it so that main() function is chosen dynamically?\n\nNot easily, we would have to specially link against libfuzzer (https://llvm.org/docs/LibFuzzer.html#using-libfuzzer-as-a-library) and provide our own main function. We could do that I guess, but I think this way is cleaner. Maybe we could do that as part of a fuzzing framework to abstract away all this boilerplate, if we ever do that.",
