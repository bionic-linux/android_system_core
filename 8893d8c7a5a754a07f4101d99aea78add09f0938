      "message": "So - there was the discussion on the other CL about one of these being parent-\u003echild and one being child-\u003eparent, and due to a possible deadlock, we need two separate pipes, but I still don\u0027t understand this. If one side reads one fifo, and the other side reads the other fifo, there is still a deadlock. The promise that there won\u0027t be a deadlock comes from the order these are read/written, and that can be fulfilled with one FD.\n\nI\u0027m not sure an extra FD matters here, but I would be interested in seeing the directionality commented here. In the future, we shouldn\u0027t be adding more for more usecases - and there only needs to be one here. It would be easy to miss.\n\nThanks (not sure about the other race issue here or other specifics, but lgtm)",
