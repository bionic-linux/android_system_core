      "message": "It seems that passing a tagged address to unwindstack::Memory::Read() may be problematic. IIUC, the concrete implementation could be MemoryRemote::Read(), which in turn uses either process_vm_readv() or ptrace(PTRACE_PEEKTEXT). Either way, these are not covered by the tagged address ABI, because the address belongs to a different address space from the calling thread. In fact if my reading is correct, both syscalls will actual fail if passed a tagged pointer.",

      "message": "Yeah, we might need to change MemoryRemote to mask the address, although in my experience it hasn\u0027t been necessary i.e. I\u0027ve seen tombstones containing memory surrounding tagged addresses (which may be a bug?)\n\nThis should be fine for now though, since this is in response to SIGILL and PC should always be untagged.",
