      "message": "begin and end were defined _afterwards_ because I found out it was used publicly; these preceded their definition. I pondered it for a moment and decided this appears clearer especially if I also had to do map.insert, map.find mixed in.\n\neg:\n\nif (it \u003d\u003d end()) {\n    if \u003d map.insert(std::make_pair(key, TEntry(e))).first\n}\n\nscared me as being a FUD maintenance issue; at least as implemented:\n\nif (it \u003d\u003d map.end()) {\n    if \u003d map.insert(std::make_pair(key, TEntry(e))).first\n}\n\nit was clear what was happening.\n\nOnce I crossed that bridge, I _had_ to use map.begin() and map.end() in the sort() implementation too for consistency.",

      "message": "I was thinking how to comment this in a rebase, and nothing made sense that would not in-turn result in more confusion. It is better IMHO to leave them as-is silently and accept that by referencing map. The \u0027fix\u0027 could be to move begin/end definitions to the bottom so they do not trigger this feeling of optimization.",
