      "message": "The reason this is failing in presubmit appears to be an emulator-specific issue.\n\nUsually, /data is mounted in late-fs, which occurs after post-fs, which is when we restorecon  /metadata and create /metadata/vold.\n\nThe emulator however mounts /data in fs, which is too early. /metadata/vold is not created yet, and /metadata has the wrong label - cache_file. To paper over this, the emulator has device-specific sepolicy that allow vold to write to cache_file.\n\nI do think a restorecon is needed in this CL, but unfortunately that runs afoul of the emulator, since vold doesn\u0027t normally have permission to mkdir() in /metadata. Adding the correct label breaks it. I\u0027ll try to address these problems first.",
