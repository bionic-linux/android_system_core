      "message": "Yes, we need this word writable. The device implements a magic i/o page that can be mmap() -ed into a user process, which can the read/write in it to communicate with the emulator,\n\nThis is how our C library can send allocation details to the emulator very quickly to implement the -memcheck option. This is also used by the VM tracing code to send quick \"method enter/exit\" events to the emulator.\n\nSimilarly, we need to be able to read()/write() to /dev/qemu_pipe from any user process.",
