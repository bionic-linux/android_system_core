If we want to consider changing this in the other way, I have no objections.  But given that the original CL landed in May, it\u0027s possible not a lot of folks are using this from C, so this CL may be sufficient.",

      "message": "most libutils headers don\u0027t support C, so -- depending on how much code is affected -- i\u0027d be happier just removing the __cplusplus cruft.\n\nin particular, this seems strictly worse. i think if we do want to keep C compatibility we should just add another function. (i feel like i suggested this on the original code review, because default parameters on non-inline functions have caused us nothing but trouble historically, even for C++.)",
