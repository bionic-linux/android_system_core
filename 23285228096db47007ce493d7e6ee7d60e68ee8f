      "message": "Follow up to https://android-review.googlesource.com/c/platform/system/core/+/1224544\n\nArguably, to the extent that we want this to be a C interface as well, we should instead introduce an additional method, like androidSetThreadPriorityAndPolicy(), to allow us to have both the 2 and 3 argument versions of the functions defined in C with compile-time type checking.\n\nBut I went with what seems the minimal change, which I think is still a strict improvement on the current state (we can now include this header again in C code, even if we don\u0027t get compile-time argument checking for one function).  If we want to consider changing this in the other way, I have no objections.  But given that the original CL landed in May, it\u0027s possible not a lot of folks are using this from C, so this CL may be sufficient.",

      "message": "I\u0027m pretty convinced that this is not only poor form (not providing type checking for caller from C), but generally incorrect for C callers just providing 2 arguments (since the calling sites from C aren\u0027t going to put a value for the 3rd argument, and we\u0027ll use uninitialized stack memory).",

(i feel like i suggested this on the original code review, because default parameters on non-inline functions have caused us nothing but trouble historically, even for C++.)",
