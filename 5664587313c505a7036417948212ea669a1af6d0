      "message": "Normally a merge starts in second-stage init, where we have access to properties. But if you reboot in the middle, the merge resumes in first-stage init, where properties aren\u0027t loaded yet. In fact, IIRC, reading a property could lead to a deadlock, unless we fixed that unilaterally. This is a case where it\u0027s safest to pipe it through the status protobuf and argv, but Akilesh should make the call on whether that\u0027s needed.\n\nEither way, I would definitely make this a parameter to the Handler, and not have it read here. Otherwise it\u0027s much more difficult to change this value in tests.",
