      "message": "Well, this comment is unrelated to your code, but this line is a bit weird. As you are updating this file, may be you\u0027ll check and update this as well.\n\nWhat do you think  - \"if (device_fd \u003c 0)\" is more correct or? To be POSIX syscall, open must return -1 on error. But what this all \"if (fd \u003c -1)\" in this file are about? I\u0027m not sure it handles error situations at all.",

      "message": "Yes, those definitely look like mistakes in the original code. They are, however, entirely unrelated to this particular fix. Personally I would compare it \u003d\u003d -1 (which is correct by the wording of the POSIX standard), but I have been told that the Google style is to compare it \u003c 0, so yes: it should be (device_fd \u003c 0). Shouldn\u0027t this be submitted as a separate patch, though?",
