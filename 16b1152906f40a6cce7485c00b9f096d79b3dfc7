      "message": "There aren\u0027t many properties set from init builtins that really care about the timing.  The only semi-complex functions like mount_all aren\u0027t doing to run in vendor_init anyway.  Unfortunately it\u0027ll take quite a large refactor to make this synchronous.  Either Subcontext::Execute() would need to be asynchronous or property service would need to be separated from init.  Neither seem likely at the moment.",
