      "message": "I created a new MAX_PAYLOAD_V2 macro and defined MAX_PAYLOAD to it. I don\u0027t want to pollute with the code with references to MAX_PAYLOAD_V2 because I think it makes the code less readable, but if you want I can change it.\n\nI experimented with various packet sizes and further increase of the packet size have almost no impact on the push/pull speed on the other hand it increases the latency linearly (because of the USB transfer speed). With 256KiB packets the packet latency is ~8ms what means that any service have at least this latency if a push/pull using the connection with full load. For \"real time services\" (e.g. logcat or shell) I think this latency is acceptable but a further increase will hurt the user experience, because the practical latency is higher then this.",
