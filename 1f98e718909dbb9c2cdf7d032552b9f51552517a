      "message": "nit: is there reference client code which uses this API?\n\nI would like to double check below use case:\n\nSince the local static variable initialized only once - the very first time the API is called, if the libstatssocket.so is not ready - the initial value will be NULL\nand each consecutive call will not try to update this value/will and try to load library again\n\nhttps://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/storage_duration#Static_local_variables\n\n```\nVariables declared at block scope with the specifier static ... are initialized the first time control passes through their declaration. On all further calls, the declaration is skipped.\n```\n\nwill it make consecutive calls to `IsAvailable` no op if very first call was too early?\n\nThank you",
