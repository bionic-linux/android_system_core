      "message": "0 is not clearer IMHO, as this was broken in 1981 ;-}, I was there when this got fixed in SysVR3 ;-/. It has since been generally accepted practice to always send the same flags you issued to open, to fcntl with the modifications you want to make for backward portability (waaaaaay backward, I admit). POSIX added the clarity regarding the O_RDONLY and friends in the documentation so that all knew they could not shoot themselves in the foot, or die trying to make it so ...\n\nAlso, if I _chose_ to allow a nonblocking flag in the future on line 98, it would be a trivial change at the top with no adjustment here. That supports code stability and reduced fragility.",
