We could write the following and it would be all the same.\n\nvoid android_memset16(uint16_t* dst, uint16_t value, size_t size) {\n    _memset16(dst, value, size);\n}\n\nIt\u0027s kind of unfortunate to have this delegating function at all.  We could just as well do something like this in a header file:\n\n#define android_memset16 _memset16",
