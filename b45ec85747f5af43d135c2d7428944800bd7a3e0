      "message": "Hi folks, this is Harry from the Android CrystalBall team. Our boot time test found that this change topic might introduce a ~2.5s (10%+) regression in boot time on the Pixel 5. We\u0027ve confirmed this by running the test twice (https://crystalball-presubmit.corp.google.com/dashboard/I72800010094013358, https://crystalball-presubmit.corp.google.com/dashboard/I37600010093959327). Could you please take another look at this change? Thank you!",

      "message": "So far I have not yet been able to reproduce these results on a Pixel 5 (Redfin) device. If I run the following command:\n\npython3 bootanalyze.py -r -c config.yaml -n 10 -g\n\nthen the results are as follows for LauncherStart+Bootloader:\n\nWith blkio in the v1 cgroup hierarchy: 55.579 +/- 0.47563 seconds.\nWith blkio in the v2 cgroup hierarchy: 55.535 +/- 0.56951 seconds.\n\nIn other words, this CL reduces the startup time slightly but the difference is smaller than the standard deviation of the measurements.\n\nAm I perhaps missing something about the boot time test results reported on the CrystalBall website?",
