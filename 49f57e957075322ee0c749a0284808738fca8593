      "message": "I\u0027m also a little wary of having a number hard-coded in there, but to me this seems somewhat esoteric to expose as an option. \n\nI\u0027ve also gathered some more data (2000 trials), and it turns out 1 second isn\u0027t nearly sufficient. On the Xoom it takes over 1 second 10% of the time. I\u0027ve seen it take as long as 2.4 seconds, although this is unusual; 99% of the time it takes 1.75 seconds or less.\n\nIf the timeout is too short it can lead to a subsequent command failing. If it\u0027s too long, worst case the command takes a little longer than necessary, and then only if the device fails to reboot, which is unlikely.\n\nBut given that I\u0027ve rarely seen it take over 2 seconds and never over 2.4, perhaps 5 is overkill. I\u0027ve changed it to 3 seconds, and also made it a named constant.",
