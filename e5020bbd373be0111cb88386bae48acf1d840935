      "message": "yeah, the target build handles that through nativetests/64. \nThis change is for compatibility suite, which output all test binaries into a flat folder (test cases). That\u0027s why there is name collision when building \"m vts-core\"\n\nOnce b/141201041 is fixed, each binary for different build arch will be stored in its own folder (x64/64), just like nativetests/64, then we won\u0027t need this workaround.",

I expect the bug will be fixed in the next couple weeks.\n\nmeanwhile, this approach has been used in several CTS tests to workaround the name collision issue. Change the behavior in CTS can have some unexpected behavior, so we\u0027d like to start the new behavior with the new suite first.",
