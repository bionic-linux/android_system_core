So I guess you are seeing the problem because after initial remount setup you didn\u0027t reboot.\n\nCould you confirm the above?\n\nIf so I think the correct _fix_ is to ensure a reboot after initial remount:\n```\n$ adb remount\n# would print something about new overlayfs is setup\n$ adb reboot\n$ adb remount\n# would print something about _existing_ overlayfs is remounted RW\n$ adb shell cat /proc/self/mountinfo\n# should be in a \"good\" mount state?\n```",
