      "message": "Technically tsan is clearly correct.  This is a data race, which has undefined behavior.  Whether it can actually fail in practice is complicated.  In the old version, I think it would be correct, for example, for the compiler to remove the second t-\u003ekicked load, since it can assume the first one doesn\u0027t race, and hence the value can\u0027t change.  That would allow t-\u003ekick(t) to execute more than once, which certainly violates the intent of the code.\n\nI suspect no current compiler does that.  I wouldn\u0027t be surprised if people are working on it.",
