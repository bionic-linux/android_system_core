Since argv[2] isn\u0027t NULL the only situation endptr will be NULL is upon success. If it *is* NULL then we check for an out-of-range number (negative numbers count as valid numbers).",

      "message": "From manpage:\nIf  endptr is not NULL, strtoul() stores the address of the first invalid character in *endptr.  If there were no digits at all, strtoul() stores the original\n       value of nptr in *endptr (and returns 0).  In particular, if *nptr is not \u0027\\0\u0027 but **endptr is \u0027\\0\u0027 on return, the entire string is valid.\n\n\nNote that it defines endptr as ** in the manpage, so your \u0026endptr will always be non-null when you pass it into the function. So, it will always store an address into endptr.",
