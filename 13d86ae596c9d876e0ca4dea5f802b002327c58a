      "message": "one of the fundamental ideas of the google3-style logging is that _libraries_ shouldn\u0027t be making decisions like this. the program they\u0027re running in the context of should make these decisions.\n\nso here i\u0027d expect that remount uses the standard stderr logger from libbase, and it sets the minimum log severity based on whether it\u0027s run with `-v` or not. there shouldn\u0027t be any need for a custom logger? (and if there is, that\u0027s well worth a comment explaining why!)",

      "message": "TBH I don\u0027t know why the special case around `[fs_mgr]`. I think the original author (Mark, who had left our team) thinks `[fs_mgr]` logs are spammy, maybe? \n\nFor the record, this change is just rewriting existing code. I\u0027m okay if we suppress any logs less severe than ERROR, and only show them with `-v`, but that would be in another change. The main point of this change is for the next change to land cleanly.\n\n\u003e custom logger?\nOTOH we do want to log to both logd AND stderr. Stderr output is useful to the user of this program. It provides diagnostic messages to the user in case of error and hints them the next step to take. Logd logs are extremely useful in bug reports.",
