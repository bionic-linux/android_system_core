      "message": "How is memcpy more endian friendly in this case? You are never accessing any of the bytes directly, you are just dereferencing a 4-byte opaque ptr and passing it as on opaque 4-byte blob to ntohl in the function call below. You never perform bit/byte operations on it until then. So, memcpy is superfluous here.\n\nThe only benefit to using memcpy here is that it is safer on platforms with hard alignment restrictions, as x could be unaligned here. So for that purpose, we should leave the memcpy, not for endianness.",
