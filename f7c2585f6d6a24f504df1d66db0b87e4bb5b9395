We may use Jiyong\u0027s suggestion in other way by adding override to a service to prevent from overridden from the other partitions because we must not have multiple services with \u0027override\u0027 flag to be agnostic to the order.\n\nBut, I also support this CL for a short-term solution.",

      "message": "Do you have a use case in mind where you\u0027d want that behavior?  We rather intentionally did not do it, since it doesn\u0027t make sense for a single partition to have multiple .rc files defining the same service, with overrides.  We pretty strictly wanted to be able to override services across partitions (though were a bit sloppy on the implementation).",
