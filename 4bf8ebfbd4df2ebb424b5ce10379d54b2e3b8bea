      "message": "Is libfdsan_standalone.so meant to be usable with multiple versions of libc.so? If so, I think bionic_tls is an issue.\n\ne.g. I see calls to strerror, which calls __get_bionic_tls (inlined), which finds bionic_tls as the last field of pthread_internal_t. Any change to pthread_internal_t (other than adding fields at the end) would break things.\n\nYou had a suggestion here (http://b/20464031#comment23) about pthread_setspecific that might be relevant?",
