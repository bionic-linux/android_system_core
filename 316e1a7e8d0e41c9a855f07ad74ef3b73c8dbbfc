      "message": "To be clear, finding other bugs is not good motivation because there is no telling that just ignoring the first problem will not result in other crashes/failures.\n\nNow, it might be useful to enable a mode to never crash and produce as many tombstones as possible, but that really should only be in a debug mode. I would still caution that this is not the best idea though since you are likely to have other false failures.",
