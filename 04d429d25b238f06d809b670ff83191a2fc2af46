      "message": "I know this is still WIP, but pulling Kalesh and Joel in.\n\nHey Amit! :) Thanks for being ontop of this issue upstream and submitting this!\n\nI think from the last time I talked w/ Joel (Joel: Correct me if I\u0027m wrong) /dev/ashmem will still be needed (even if it can be reduced mostly to a memfd stub) for existing applications in the playstore that access it directly. But that can be carried in ACK until those apps can be properly considered deprecated.\n\nBut I do think this is a necessary change to drop the unnecessary dependency on it in AOSP.\n\nI\u0027m torn on using the kernel version as the switch, as future ACKs will likely have some sort of /dev/ashmem, so that might confuse folks, but I also suspect just switching the flag to default to true would cause grief on devices that need the seccomp/sepolicy change.\n\nShould the secomp / sepolicy changes instead be made in the shared policy files?",
