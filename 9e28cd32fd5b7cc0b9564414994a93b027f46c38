      "message": "Thanks, but I still am not sure if this is right.\n\n\u003e cuttlefish isn\u0027t ready for product\n\nCould you elaborate? Why is the product partition mentioned here? This isn\u0027t about Cuttlefish itself, but about tools to launch it inside an Android device, right? The tools are quite generic; they are agnostic to the underlying SoC. They are not specific to Android as well because they have been running on regular desktop Linux. So the vendor partition doesn\u0027t seem to be the right place for the tools.\n\nI am not particularly against making this lib (or any other lib) available to vendor as long as the libs are NOT part of VNDK. What I am concerning here is the location of the tools. Why can\u0027t we have these inside /system or /system_ext?",

I agree that cuttlefish should ultimately be in the system image, but there are a lot of cleanups to make. The tool in question (our disk image assembler) may not even make the final cut. More work is needed to integrate vm management.\n\nWe need this CL just to unblock building our components so the team can work on cleaning it up in AOSP, and then we can move it into system when it\u0027s in good shape and works for everybody. I\u0027m happy to revert this CL once we land in system.img (if necessary.)",
