      "message": "Thanks, but I still am not sure if this is right.\n\n\u003e cuttlefish isn\u0027t ready for product\n\nCould you elaborate? Why is the product partition mentioned here? This isn\u0027t about Cuttlefish itself, but about tools to launch it inside an Android device, right? The tools are quite generic; they are agnostic to the underlying SoC. They are not specific to Android as well because they have been running on regular desktop Linux. So the vendor partition doesn\u0027t seem to be the right place for the tools.\n\nI am not particularly against making this lib (or any other lib) available to vendor as long as the libs are NOT part of VNDK. What I am concerning here is the location of the tools. Why can\u0027t we have these inside /system or /system_ext?",
