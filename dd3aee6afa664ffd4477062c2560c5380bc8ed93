      "message": "IMHO, epoll_wait failing should be a plain abort. There\u0027s no legitimate reason for it to fail, so if it _does_ fail, something has gone terribly wrong. And here, you just log that something\u0027s gone wrong and retry! What if you retry in a loop, and we end up pinning a core with a SCHED_FIFO process?\n\nBy aborting, you at least have a hope of getting back into a known state.\n\nDon\u0027t take my word for it: GMS\u0027s casting network-dispatch doohickey has a chronic bug involving its own epoll returning early with an unexpected error condition, causing the event processing loop to spin on a core forever, chewing through battery.\n\nIt\u0027s good to fail fast in impossible situations, but I think it\u0027s especially important to fail fast in critical system daemons like this one.",
