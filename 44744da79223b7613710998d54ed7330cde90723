      "message": "This will work for things like /data that are not in dm-linear, but I don\u0027t think it will work for things mounted through dm-linear like /system on blueline.  \n\nWe\u0027d want to return it\u0027s \u0027logical\u0027 fstab entry, right?  That means we\u0027d need to check the fstab at each iteration of the the dm recursion, right?  Since /system is mounted on dm-verity, is mounted on dm-linear (which we want to detect), is mounted on the underlying super partition.\n\nWe should add a test case that it can resolve \"/system\" as well to detect this case.",

      "message": "I\u0027m not sure I have a good solution for /system, apart from special casing. IIUC on blueline /system is not even mounted directly, but instead / is mounted on a dm device.\n\nGiven that use case I\u0027m implementing with this CL is \"get additional metadata about mount point (e.g. whenever it\u0027s support checkpointing), not available in /proc/mounts\", I am erring towards not supporting logical partitions, and renaming this method to GetMountedEntryForUserdata. WDYT?\n\nIf you think, that there is value in having a generic version, I\u0027m happy to take another shot in implementing it in one of the follow up CLs, in order not to block my userspace reboot work (this one is a prerequisite to support it on devices with ext4 userdata).",

      "message": "That\u0027s a good point about system as root devices that mount / as a dm device.  We\u0027ll need to handle those devices too.\n\nThat\u0027s not true anymore for blueline though.  It goes through the same dm-linear flow as the rest of our devices.  It has a ramdisk, mounts system.img in the ramdisk, then does change_root to /.\n\n[    0.963836] init: init first stage started!\n[    0.963960] init: Switching root to \u0027/first_stage_ramdisk\u0027\n[    1.046080] init: [libfs_mgr]Created logical partition system_b on device /dev/block/dm-0\n[    1.046669] init: [libfs_mgr]Created logical partition vendor_b on device /dev/block/dm-1\n[    1.047239] init: [libfs_mgr]Created logical partition product_b on device /dev/block/dm-2\n...\n[    1.060134] init: Switching root to \u0027/system\u0027\n\nThat said, you\u0027re right in that there\u0027s a special case from \u0027/\u0027 to \u0027system\u0027.
