      "message": "Should we use the term \"u16string\" instead of \"ws(tring)\"? wstrings are not in the fixed size in C++ standard, and it means a different thing than u16strings.\n\nhttps://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/types:\n\n\u003e In practice, it is 32 bits and holds UTF-32 on Linux and many other non-Windows systems, but 16 bits and holds UTF-16 code units on Windows. The standard used to require wchar_t to be large enough to represent any supported character code point. However, such requirement cannot be fulfilled on Windows, and thus it is considered as a defect and removed.",
