      "message": "I tried using bionic\u0027s constants but I guess I should add a dependency on bionic which I don\u0027t think it\u0027s what you are suggesting.\n\nBTW __ANDROID_API_Q__ is already set to 29. The problem here is that if you build the OS from HEAD (aosp or internal) as of today the device will still report being API level 28 (as per get_device_api_level()). I have been explained that the API bump in the build system will only happen at release time. Since I want developers to use ADB to start testing .apex packages using internal builds, it feels OK to have this in place for now. The alternative would be to ask developers to hack their builds by e.g. by setting PLATFORM_VERSION_SDK manually in their environment.",

The way the adb install flow is designed, it seems to me, is to just be a proxy of cmd, intercepted on packagemanager side by PackageManagerShellCommand. Therefore, whether apex is supported or not does not depend on adbd on the phone side.\n\nNote also that, assuming that I do the change you request and I add a new adb feature, we would be exactly in the same situation on an AOSP build as we are with API-level check, i.e. we\u0027d assume that the phone supports the feature because adbd says so, but in reality the AOSP version of API doesn\u0027t still have support for the feature and will fail, outputin.\n\nI cc\u0027d you to the WIP internal change on the PM side, id I3ac7971ce6923511a7d574291fe9002c5d55fa1b .",

Flags seems to be the common way to characterise the content of the APK: for example I see that they are used for indicating whether an apk being streamed is an instant app or not. In a previous version of this CL I was thinking of having the user specify --apex on the command line, but then I thought that the auto-detection based on file suffix would have resulted in a better user experience.\n\nI could move the APK vs APEX detection on the PM side but that would require some inspection of the package. Note that an APEX has certain characteristics of an APK like the APK signature and a basic XML manifest, but nothing more. I think passing the flag would simplify the logic on the PM side and be consistent with other similar use cases.\n\nSee I3ac7971ce6923511a7d574291fe9002c5d55fa1b internally for the proposed changes to PM.",

      "message": "I think that without this line adb will skip the file and silently stop parsing the other command line arguments.\n\nAssuming that we also accept APEX files (e.g. if we add\n\n|| android::base::EndsWithIgnoreCase(file, \".apex\")\n\nbelow line 405, part of the problem is that in the current implementation there is an install flag (INSTALL_APEX) set for the entire session. So if you attempt to pass the file without setting the flag, the package manager will likely fail at some point when trying to install this as an apk. I can test this behaviour more thoroughly if you want but given that it would require carefully crafting the scenario for failure I\u0027m not sure whether it\u0027s worth covering.",
