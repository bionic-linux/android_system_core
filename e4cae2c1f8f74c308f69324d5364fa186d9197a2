The \"unknown\" string above was not meant to match a boot reason string containing \u0027unknown\u0027 (at the time there weren\u0027t known devices reporting \u0027unknown\u0027 as a boot reason).  I think we need to change the string at line 142 to be bootstat_unknown or similar and keep this unknown string match.",
