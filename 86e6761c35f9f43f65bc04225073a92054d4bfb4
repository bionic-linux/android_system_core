      "message": "I know that it really is close to zero that the open log will fail, it\u0027s not 0% chance. So adding the check doesn\u0027t seem too bad.\n\nAn earlier version had a timeout reading the log, but that seems really iffy since I already have a maximum number of messages to read from the log.\n\nThere is no easy way to add a timeout to the read message unless I rework the logd process and liblog to add a timeout option. That feels like overkill since the only way this could happen in the future is that logd has stopped processing pending threads and gets in to a really bad state.",
