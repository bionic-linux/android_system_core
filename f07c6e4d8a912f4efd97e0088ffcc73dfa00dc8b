If factory image, for example, 1.7GB there will be only 300MB physical space left for logical partition served as a backing storage, while cache has 1.5GB.\n\n2. Please check my answer for David\u0027s comment\n\nWhile answering your questions, I realize that non-A/B device may be configured to store OTA package in the /data dir, while having small /cache. @dvander@google.com @yochiang@google.com If you agree with the general idea I am talking about, what do you think if I do ```if (!IsABDevice() \u0026\u0026 GetBoolProperty(kPreferCacheBackingStorageProp, false))``` in this patchset?",

      "message": "Thanks a lot for your review!\n\n\u003e non-AB is no longer supported\n\nDo you mean that non-A/B configuration is deprecated? I know that it is considered legacy, but still legal to use. As far as I can see, device/amlogic/yukawa reference target is non-A/B\n\n\u003e remount should be going through the /data path rather than /cache\n\nYou are right, but there are 2 concerns about data that I see:\n\n1. as you mentioned, it might have no reliable pinning in f2fs configuration, and api_level check might not help when the code runs on old enough kernel.\n\n2. /data may be actively used by applications leaving not much space for backing storage.\n\nMeanwhile, /cache is almost always free since it is used only to store OTA package. /cache partition size should be large enough to hold OTA package, that contains update up to the whole super size. So /cache is almost always large enough to be overlay for the most of super\u0027s data.",
