      "message": "I\u0027d be tempted to take the entire logic to libselinux for opening property_contexts, as we already do for all other policy files.  But I remember that there was a desire to keep it here because of the tight coupling to init property service.  If we have to keep it here, it should be less strongly linked to the libselinux internals, i.e. index shouldn\u0027t be exposed.",
