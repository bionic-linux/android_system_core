      "message": "These lines are here so that they execute after the `next_process_action_time` lines.\n\nThe code after this change would have a bug: if there are commands in the queue waiting to be run and there is a process that is waiting to restart, `epoll_timeout` would be set to the timeout for `next_process_action_time` and not 0ms as expected.\n\nI think you could do `if (next_process_action_time \u0026\u0026 epoll_timeout !\u003d 0ms)` to avoid that issue.",
