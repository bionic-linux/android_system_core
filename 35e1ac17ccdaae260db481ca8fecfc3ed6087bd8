      "message": "metrics_collector.h doesn\u0027t compile without adding gtest, dbus, and weaved to the include path.  The metrics_collector executable gets the above two thru its shared libs dependencies on libdbus and libweaved.  The libmetricscollector library only needs to get the header file to compile; it doesn\u0027t actually depend on the library code.  So I did it this way.  \n\nNow that I think of it, metrics_collector_service_impl.cc was only compiled here in the library to be -fnortti.  I can probably now move it to compile with metrics_collector executable and get the include paths that way.",
