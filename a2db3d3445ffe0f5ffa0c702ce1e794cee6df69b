You should add that to the comment.\n\nHowever, is there a way to add some kind of timeout mechanism so that we don\u0027t need to have this specific check? It seems brittle to do it this way because it\u0027s possible some oem could change the name or we could at some later date. And it does seem like it could be possible that activity manager could hang in some other way.",
