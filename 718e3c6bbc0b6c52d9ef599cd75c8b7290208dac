      "message": "IMO we should avoid this dynamic check. AIUI, lmkd will be used only on devices that are 4.14 or newer. Old devices just use the in-kernel LMK. Can we enforce pidfd_open availability as a part of VTS testing for new devices? I feel this check complicates things, it is much better to just write the code so it works only with pidfd_open and enforce that devices are compatible.\n\nLet us talk about this more on this thread.",
