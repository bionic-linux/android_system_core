      "message": "rootdir/init.rc line 728 already does the following:\n\n    mkdir /data/misc 01771 system misc encryption\u003dRequire\n\nIf I understand correctly, none of the /data/misc subfolders are supposed to set the encryption policy since /data/misc itself has it set. I don\u0027t see any other /data/misc subfolder setting the encryption policy flag.\n\nCorrect me if I\u0027m wrong but before aosp/2676056 it was required since it was a top level folder not covered by other encryption policies.\n\nThis change fixes boot on various devices after the 14 QPR2 merge",
