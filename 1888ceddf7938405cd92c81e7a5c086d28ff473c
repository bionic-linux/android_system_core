      "message": "I\u0027m confused by this. Per \"man fcntl\", the only supported F_SETFD flag is \"FD_CLOEXEC\". Passing in O_NDELAY, O_RDONLY, O_WRONLY, or O_RDWR doesn\u0027t seem to do anything.\n\nAs O_NDELAY is defined as O_NONBLOCK, and O_NONBLOCK is settable via F_SETFL, perhaps you meant that? F_SETFL !\u003d F_SETFD.\n\nAlso, no return value checking.\n\nIs this really needed at all? This should be entirely handled by the open() call... If not, it\u0027s a race.",
