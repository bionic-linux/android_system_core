      "message": "Look at system/core/libcutils/include_vndk/cutils/log.h where we added a \u0027soft\u0027 compile deprecation warning. We should have something like this at least in the libutils/include_vndk/utils/Log.h file.\n\nYMMV since some in-tree compilations still treat that soft warning as a hard (-Werror) warning, but the vndk side should _never_ use this file so we do not care that much about it. I am sure there are more pragma/compiler tricks that could be added to make it more robust for in-tree and out-of-tree compilation.",
