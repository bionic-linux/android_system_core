      "message": "We already link a shared libbase to libcutils.  I think we should use the std::map in libbase here instead of have a second copy of it.  Or otherwise, we should have a shared host library that implements __system_property_set(), __system_property_get(), etc.\n\nAs nice as it is to have system properties on host, I think it would be exceptionally confusing to people that libcutils\u0027s and libbase\u0027s view of them is not the same.",
