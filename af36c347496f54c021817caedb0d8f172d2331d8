This is clearly something that isn\u0027t impossible, but it\u0027s also something that points to at least strongly indicates that something on your system is broken, which might be worthy of a fatal error. (The cause in the bug report is two processes opening 78 and 40 inotify fds each, exhausting the per-user inotify fd limit).)",

If we do fully die here I think we at least need to somehow expose a message up to the user or it\u0027s just going to look like adb is broken and dying for no reason.",
