      "message": "The actual path is signal handler sets a semaphore, and an administrative thread clears the semaphore and takes the actions to call things like this ::init() function, to which this issues a trigger to all the logtime entries while holding a LogTimeEntry::lock() which sends a pthread_cond to the associated reader threads to wake up. So, we are not in the signal handler context here or in the reader threads.",
