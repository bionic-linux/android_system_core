      "message": "EFAULT has been recognized as acceptable response by upstream for passing a NULL pointer for a known command. The concern I have is that ASHMEM_GET_SIZE should be completely orthogonal and never be viewed as a known command.\n\nThe failure report (below) is a signal that may be viewed as unfixable on some drivers (eg: layers: net/core/dev_ioctl.c dev_ioctl() function for example because _all_ ioctls require the ability to take a struct ifreq for a class of vendor private commands that get propagated to the hardware driver for further processing and for return back to caller).",
