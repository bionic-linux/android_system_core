OEM libs are not somethings that are present for all android devices. This is an extra part and (well designed) apps using these libraries should be able to work on android devices without them.",

No build-time and run-time enforcement is necessary because CTS/VTS on GSI can guarantee everything.\n\nI don\u0027t see a reason for an SoC company (which owns the vendor partition) to use a library in system library defined by OEM which is a downstream of the SoC vendor. Since an SoC can be sold to any OEM, it can\u0027t assume a specific OEM library. That just doesn\u0027t make sense logically.",
