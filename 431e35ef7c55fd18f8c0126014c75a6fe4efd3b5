(if so, could you add the rationale as a comment?) b/192011293 seems to be motivated by Pixel and F2FS and the performance test was done only for the configuration. But this setting is applied any Android device even if it doesn\u0027t use F2FS. I thought such a tuning should be done in vendor-specific rc files. Am I missing something?",
