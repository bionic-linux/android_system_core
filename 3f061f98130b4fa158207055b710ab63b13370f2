      "message": "i _think_ we tried that before, but that also causes carnage? there\u0027s really no good answer when multiple headers both want ERROR...\n\nlooks like google3 has since moved to a different set of names (like kError) here and then has more complicated #define stitching elsewhere that can cope with ERROR being 0 and a bogus INTERNAL_SEVERITY_0 that\u0027s the same as INTERNAL_SEVERITY_ERROR. which sounds like a good idea, but potentially a large disruptive change to get there. file a bug and go with this workaround for now?
