      "message": "so this was static above, but non-static here. and then in the art change, it seemed like we include libz again as a static library? shouldn\u0027t it just be done here as static and then not again in users of this library?",

      "message": "Sorry. That was the intention. I was fiddling around with static vs shared to measure sizes and I must have left this half reverted.\n\n(I was also fiddling around with renaming libz-host -\u003e libz since we don\u0027t really need a different name, and it complicates other makefiles but I decided to leave that for a follow up)",

      "message": "we found it a lot clearer to have the -host suffixes, there were issues doing minimal builds sometimes without it. for example, when you require a module in the PRODUCT_PACKAGES, it doesn\u0027t know to do only one and not both.",
