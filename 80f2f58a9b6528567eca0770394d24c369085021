      "message": "i think it\u0027s _really_ important specifically with async crashes --- the reason i was reading this carefully was that bug earlier today where i genuinely don\u0027t know what this means in practice. (\"context switch\" kind of implies it should be on the same thread at least, but since i have multiple _cores_ maybe not? executed on _the core that had the fault_ or executed on _any_ core?)",
