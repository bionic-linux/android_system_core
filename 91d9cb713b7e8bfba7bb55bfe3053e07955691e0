We usually do have the proper init on our QCOM boards\u0027 init.*.rc. But caught a case that didn\u0027t have it set in time before the ConfigFS rules are executed resulting in dummy_udc getting selected. On these boards the previous behavior relied on init having chosen the correct one, so that\u0027s what sparked this change--its purpose was to allow init to choose a \"reasonable\" default.\n\n\n\u003e Also, some testing systems want to set the dummy_udc device, so I think this will break them.  There\u0027s a reason we added it to the kernel configuration :)\n\nWhy can\u0027t the argument extend to these systems as well, couldn\u0027t their init.*.rc set sys.usb.controller\u003ddummy_udc.0 explicitly for testing purposes?",

At least for our boards we can make sure to always have the property set from init.${ro.hardware}.rc or /vendor/{build,default}.prop\n\nIs there an easy way to cushion the blow for boards that aren\u0027t prepared for it?
