Doing a quick audit, it looks fine right now, but aosp/1508583 would be broken by this.\n\nAs a quick workaround, can we pass \"created_devices\" to DoFirstStageMount() and let it choose whether to call DoCreateDevices? Then we can refactor this later and figure out something cleaner (like moving FirstStageMount to its own header).",
