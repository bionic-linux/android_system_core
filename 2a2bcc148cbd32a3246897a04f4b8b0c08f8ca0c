I am not too keen on adding an errno field to Result just to support this one off use case.  I understand that it\u0027s not pretty but I\u0027m okay with the string comparison especially since it\u0027s a failure use case anyway.",

      "message": "Perhaps a new builtin could be created that explicitly allows for EEXIST as a failure mode and keep this one to report the failures?\n\nThis is definitely better than what we\u0027ve had before (no error reporting here) and it should be trivial to see that a symlink failed due to EEXIST when debugging, which is why I\u0027m okay with doing this as is.",
