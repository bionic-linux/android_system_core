(especially because all of system/core just has one big TEST_MAPPING rather than us actually specifying which tests matter to which projects. i notice in particular that all the adb tests should probably have moved out when adb did!)",

      "message": "+1 Inseob, please add the reasons.\n\nTo answer that here, it\u0027s because many (but not all) components under /system/core are used also in microdroid and therefore any change here could potentially break microdroid. This can happen especially when the change (ex: in `init`) requires additional changes in sepolicy where we have separate *.te files for Android and microdroid (because microdroid is much smaller/simpler than Android and thus policies for Android is too permissive for microdroid). TEST_MAPPING in /system/sepolicy already triggers the microdroid tests, but we need the same here as well in case when a change in /system/core doesn\u0027t involve a change in /system/sepolicy because the change is already granted by the existing *.te files for Android, but not by *.te files for microdroid.",
