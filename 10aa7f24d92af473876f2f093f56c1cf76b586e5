In that case, we would need to provide `sp\u003cT\u003e sp\u003cT\u003e::selfRef()`. Actually - let try that. No reason to have this partial solution.",

      "message": "I\u0027m not sure I fully understand yet what you have in mind. What about Line 64?\n\nOtherwise I like the approach. There is the usual concern that repeated and nested includes don\u0027t really work as desired. We probably need a strong recommendation to only define ANDROID_UTILS_SP_DISABLE_IMPLICIT_* at the beginning of .cpp files or with compiler flags. And you may have to clean up a bunch of seemingly unrelated .h files to do that. But it still looks feasible.",
