      "message": "There are several possibilities:\n- Either by inspecting that code. It is relatively easy to see that that code does not queue actions to the am object.\n- Or by adding a comment above the code that computes next_process_action_time that explains that that code should not queue actions.\n\nAnother solution would be not to use the singleton pattern for the ActionManager class but that would be a very invasive solution. This would require to pass the ActionManager object to many methods.\n\nDo you perhaps have a preference?",
