That is quite counter intuitive to me.\n\nWhy don\u0027t we record the fact that a specific event was once triggered? Then we could check if this.event_trigger_ was in the list of already-triggered events.",

      "message": "We thought that `on boot` triggers should always happen during the `boot` phase and in a defined order. For example, this test [1] ensures that all `on boot` triggers happen in order within a given file regardless of if they have property conditions on them. It would be confusing to read/write .rc files and make init less deterministic if we stored the event phase and replayed them.\n\nThere\u0027s also the situation where, a property changes multiple times to its trigger value. We explicitly did not want this to trigger multiple times if an event trigger is also used. For example `on boot \u0026\u0026 property:foo\u003dbar` should not trigger twice if the property `foo` is set to `bar`, then `blah`, then back to `bar`.\n\nWhat is the use case that you\u0027re thinking of where you\u0027d want \"name is set to value some time after boot is triggered\" ?\n\n1: https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/+/master:system/core/init/init_test.cpp;l\u003d130?q\u003df:init_test.cpp",
