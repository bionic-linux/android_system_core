The system_server needs to know which ABI each zygote supports.\n\n(I suppose I could implement that by having the system_server query the ABI list from the zygote as soon as it opens the connection.)\n\nI do like Colin\u0027s idea of using ro.product.cpu.abis32 / abis64 but the issue there is that there are no *existing* BoardConfig.mk variables I could use unless I can assume that TARGET_CPU is 64 bit if TARGET_2ND_CPU is present.",
