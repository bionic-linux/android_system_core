      "message": "I added a test that uses the new unwind information for x86 and x86_64 so that we get good coverage of this new code. I did this by intentionally modifying the libc.so copies so that the signal handler pattern matcher fails. I did not add a test for __restore_rt in x86 because the test isn\u0027t for the unwind information but for the code itself, but I wanted to do it for x86 and x86_64.\n\nOtherwise, this change looks good. I remove the #if 0 and removed the hacks.\n\nThanks again for this patch.",
