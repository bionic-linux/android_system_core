Would it ever be invalid to assume that \u0027/\u0027 as a mount point means system?  Seems that we can just drop this entirely and keep the rest of the code in the overlayfs file.",

However, the check for system_root_image is in multiple places (including recovery) where ramdisk is \u0027/\u0027. \n\nI do not have the bravery to drop this system_root check ;-/ but I assure you I tried it (very early on in my investigation) and everything seemed to work.",
