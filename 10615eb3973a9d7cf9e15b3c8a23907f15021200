      "message": "I\u0027m happy to set it to lower if you have good data on what a better value should be.  We had seen fsck() in the shutdown thread taking 300 seconds and sometimes even more when the reboot code was first developed.  That was one of the major reasons fsck was moved to reboot from boot and why I set this value so high.\n\nThere is the ro.build.shutdown.watchdog.timeout property too if you\u0027d like to override this on a per device basis.",
