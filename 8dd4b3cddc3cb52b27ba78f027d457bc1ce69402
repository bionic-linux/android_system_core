      "message": "Yeah, this sort of heuristic is going to cause a lot of pain.\n\nWhy not just assume UTF-8 unless the entire archive is CP-437 ? That\u0027s really the safest thing to do since any API that guesses things like this likely to be flaky / surprising.\n\n(Assuming CP-437 in this scenario is dangerous, because then we are essentially ignoring the entry_name length of each entry).",

      "message": "The problem is that very often our jars/apks have everything encoded with CP-437 except manifest which is in UTF-8. In such case we would misinterpret most of the names. If we have to pick one encoding then CP-437 is probably safer. What do you think?",
