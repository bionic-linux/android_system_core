      "message": "Once libc+libpackageparser added and supported, we should evaluate the cost of serializing getpwuid into logd.daemon where MAC, DAC and general thread safety are maintained. This will add a comfort factor with regards to getpwuid and the _ugly_ getpwuid_r debate.\n\nStill worth implementing WEAK __package_aid_to_name in libc as __LIBC_ABI_PRIVATE__ just in case in Phase 5 to allow a more efficient implementation detail should the cost of rpc to logd.daemon be too expensive for every request.",
