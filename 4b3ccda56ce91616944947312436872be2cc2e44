      "message": "Do we actually need to get the old transport back out of FastBootDriver?  I figure if we own the transport, then we know the status of it directly.  I guess this is needed since transport is a local in FastBootTool::Main() and not accessible in this function, right?  \n\nIn some ideal world, I figure we\u0027d have these all as member functions of FastBootTool (or at least able to access it), a unique_ptr\u003cTransport\u003e that contains the transport (and thus not needing new/delete), then passing the pointer to FastBootDriver, which we would initialize second and therefore guarantee the lifetime is sane.\n\nMaybe we\u0027ll get there, for now this is good enough though.",
