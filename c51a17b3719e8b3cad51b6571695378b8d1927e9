      "message": "probably a better question for cferris@ than for me.\n\n\nwith \"pre P\" being O-MR1; how long can an O-MR1 /vendor match up with a later /system.  P and Q -- almost for sure.  R, S, and now T -- gets less likely.\n\nI was a bit worried because I wanted my change above for loading in modules that will run on Q, which would almost certainly fit in with the \"could be paired with an O-MR1 /vendor\", but realized that the copy of this file I\u0027d be dragging back to a Q device would be within the module and not located at /system/etc/seccomp_policy, so the old vendor partition would not be referencing this new instance of the file.",
