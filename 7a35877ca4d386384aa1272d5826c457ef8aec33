Else we need tests, and nobody ever runs tests... :-(\n\nThere are two problems that I see, though:\n\n1) We might have to wait till all of the framework is available in AOSP, not sure...\n2) The ART test doesn\u0027t have access to the framework, I think, so we\u0027d have to create a minimal class there.",
