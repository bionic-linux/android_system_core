      "message": "It was semi-deliberate to treat them the same (although I could equally have added a new one but didn\u0027t see much point): \"5\" currently indicates a distro versioning issue. The status code is only there for testing so I can be sure the binary is failing tests for the right reason.\n\nBeyond a certain point if I added new status codes they could be added ad-hoc (there\u0027s no need for ordering, it just keeps the code tidy right now).\n\nFYI - I currently have a junit test that checks the behavior. I intend to rewrite it as a host-side test and submit once I go through the pain of having tzdatacheck executable by shell (which requires an API review).",
