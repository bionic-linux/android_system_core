I\u0027d been thinking of making a tool that launches a process as if init were launching it, e.g. sets the user, groups, capabilities, opens files, sockets, calls writepid, etc.  It could then be used with gdb, etc for testing.\n\nThat would remove all of the uncertainty and allow all of the service information to be stored in a single location next to the service.",
