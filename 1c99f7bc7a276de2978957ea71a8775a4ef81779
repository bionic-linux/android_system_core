I checked my desktop and that is the case there.\n\nWe have /dev/block/by-name which includes \u0027userdata\u0027 as a symlink to the block device that backs \u0027userdata\u0027.  Albeit, it\u0027s the actual block device that holds the partition, not the dm-verity device that /data is mounted on.",
