      "message": "I significantly reworked this patch because the number of dontaudits I had to chase down was ridiculously high, and I wanted to minimize that. The new version has a few changes:\n\n(1) We no longer explicitly compute the context for snapuserd. We just restorecon the binary as we do for /system/bin/init, and thus, don\u0027t need a dontaudit for compute_create.\n\n(2) We do not probe /metadata until we\u0027re sure we\u0027re going to launch snapuserd. This is done by checking if the initial snapuserd environment variable was set.\n\n(3) We don\u0027t restorecon /dev/block recursively anymore. This requires many unnecessary dontaudits, some of which are device specific.",
