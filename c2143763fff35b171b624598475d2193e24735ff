      "message": "Yes. I tested this on Pixel 6 with full OTA takes roughly about ~45 minutes.\n\nAdditionally, there aren\u0027t much I/O traffic during postinstall. It is only during Verifying phase we need the daemon to serve the I/O\u0027s during OTA install. Hence, we have the worker threads NICE value slightly at a higher priority but also making sure that those threads don\u0027t take up big cores.\n\nI want to stage this for U and get some soak time in weekly builds. Hope this is clear.",
