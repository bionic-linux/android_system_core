Otherwise it will just not work and I will have no way of figuring out what\u0027s the problem.\n\n2. This string says nothing about the security. Is is dangerous to print a message?",

      "message": "(1) Grammar purists will complain about it. \"at position\" is clearer.\n\n(2) I think Elliott\u0027s point is that it\u0027s dangerous to print a string that we rejected because we suspect users are fudging around with it. In this case you have an upper bound on the length so it\u0027s ok.\n\nTo look at it another way : The developers of the APK don\u0027t need to know *which* entry is wrong, do they ? It will take a few seconds to use zipinfo or unzip to get the answer. Also, the chances of this happening accidentally are remote...",
