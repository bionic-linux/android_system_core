      "message": "Could you expand some more about your concern?\n\nMy thinking is that it seems more surprising / confusing to have `fastboot devices` ignore explicitly set (via -s/ANDROID_SERIAL/FASTBOOT_DEVICE) network devices.\n\nObviously we don\u0027t consider it confusing when scripts that don\u0027t specify -s `fastboot flash` fail to flash network devices (which is common). And setting environment variables usually can fix that issue, with the exception of any scripts that depend on `fastboot devices`",

      "message": "The other commands that respect serial number arguments operate on a single device, so the behavior when specifying a serial number is clear. `fastboot devices` lists all devices, not only the one specified by the serial number (e.g. should only list the device with the provided serial number). What do you think about a separate command to query for a specific device instead (respecting the serial number args).\n\nI guess the main potential issue I see is code would work just fine with physical devices, since they would always be listed, but the behavior would only change for network devices. I can\u0027t say I have any examples of this on hand though.\n\nAlso, have you tested that this works as expected with Tradefed? usually there are multiple devices on a single lab host, so I would expect tradefed to do a list with `fastboot devices` and then filter for the specific device vs passing the specific device to search for (could be wrong on this though). In the lab/tradefed case where there are usually multiple devices on a single host would a separate argument that takes a list of devices be better? Otherwise how would you be able to support multiple devices at the same time in the `fastboot devices` output?",
