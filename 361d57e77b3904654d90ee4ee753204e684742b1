      "message": "Aside: We need to replace the `{ ... }` syntax with `std::span( ... )` temporarily to work around a bug in the pre-standardized std::span in external/libcxx, which uses a ptrdiff_t size (signed) instead of the finalized size_t size (unsigned). This code needs to compile with both the old libc++ and the new one, until b/175635923 is finished.\n\nThe `{ ... }` syntax rejects the size_t -\u003e ptrdiff_t coercion because it could truncate values, but the `std::span( ... )` allows the coercion.",
