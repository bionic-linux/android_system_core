      "message": "Hmm. That is a very good idea. Unfortunately not easily implementable. We generate killinfo_log at the time of killing and stop_wait_for_proc_kill() is called only after the process got killed. Most of the data in killinfo_log is very dynamic (like meminfo) and we have to collect it at the moment we kill. The easiest way would be to have a separate log for the kill time but that might make the log too chatty. Will consider the options in the follow-up patches.",
