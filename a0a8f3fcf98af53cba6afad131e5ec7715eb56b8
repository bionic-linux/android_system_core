      "message": "Is that actually what the shell does?  I don\u0027t see that in the few commands that I ran.\n\nIn any case, I\u0027d rather not bake this in.  I almost wish we hadn\u0027t had a string for command for the API into liblogcat.  We could have had a LogcatCommand class where users filled out the information they wanted explicitly with setters.  It would have prevented the need for getopt_long_r() and been much more intuitive in situations like this.",
