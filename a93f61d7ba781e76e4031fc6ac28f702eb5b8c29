      "message": "I had some suggestions, but I thought it\u0027d be easier to push a CL myself, since you\u0027re not building AOSP: https://android-review.googlesource.com/c/platform/system/core/+/1526382\n\nI want to keep the legacy ordering too, since if we\u0027re going to let older devices have the old behavior, we should keep it identical.\n\nI expect it\u0027s going to take quite some effort to get this CL merged though, since we\u0027ll need to clean up all of the existing /vendor/ueventd.rc in our tree.",
