      "message": "In \"theory\", freezing is not required. If we in the future modify the format of the description file, we could update the snapshot of this library for the old VNDK version to understand the new format.\n\nHowever, since updating the vndk snapshot is not a trivial task, freezing the format (or at least keep it in a backward compatible way) is much more desirable.\n\nBy describing the schema of the file in XSD and adding it to a xsd_config module, the backward compatibility is guaranteed and you will get free XML parser.
