      "message": "ReadFileToString() does not currently support Unicode filenames on Windows so this effectively breaks adb push with Unicode filenames on Windows with small-sized files. I found this by running the python Unicode unittest that you wrote. :)\n\nPotential fix ideas:\n\n* Short-term: don\u0027t do the small-sized file optimization for Windows, killing the perf benefit for Windows, but getting things working again.\n* Move the Windows Unicode stuff into android::base. I\u0027m not really a fan of this since the code still feels too new to move into android::base.\n* Just move a little bit of Windows Unicode stuff into android::base. It might be possible to do this with only 20-30 lines and it would be under #ifdef _WIN32 so it wouldn\u0027t impact the unix users of android::base.\n* ...?\n\nI see that there are many people on this code review, so if you want to discuss further, email is ok too. Thanks.",
