The result would be that we add an alias that follows in the footsteps of logd.auditd. You can block the buffer (kernel), or you can block the internal daemon (klogd), both work.\n\nI do not believe anyone was using it before, so I do not need to preserve it for legacy. I also do not believe in offering too many (hidden or visible) choices.",
