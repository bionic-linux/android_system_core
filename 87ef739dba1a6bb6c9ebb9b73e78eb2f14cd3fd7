Android Studio itself uses the folders that vary with the platform: https://intellij-support.jetbrains.com/hc/en-us/articles/206544519-Directories-used-by-the-IDE-to-store-settings-caches-plugins-and-logs\n\nA few months ago we had someone complaining that we are polluting the home directory, and he had a link to some authoritative linux recommendation. I\u0027ve forgotten what that was but http://www.pathname.com/fhs/pub/fhs-2.3.html seems like a possibility. That seems to give a specific recommendation for lock files: http://www.pathname.com/fhs/pub/fhs-2.3.html#VARLOCKLOCKFILES.\n\nI don\u0027t know if any of that helps, but if you start with $HOME/.android, I\u0027d be perfectly fine with that as long as you are using it specifically for tiny files. (Specifically because $HOME/.android is where we keep a uid.txt)\n\nIf you need a more specific recommendation, let me know and I can email the team.",
