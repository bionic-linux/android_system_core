But once property service gets split out of init anyway, that whole code path will change and I\u0027m not sure if we\u0027d want to pass the credentials of who set a property to property change listeners (we almost definitely would not want to in general; perhaps only init?).\n\nSo it seems that for now (and maybe in general) this location, while non-ideal, is fine.",
