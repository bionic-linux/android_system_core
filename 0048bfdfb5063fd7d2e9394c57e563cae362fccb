      "message": "This _will_ work. I have no _real_ problem with this, just want to add some notes.\n\nFYI APEX makes a mess of the df output because some of \u0027em are bind mounted inheriting the overlayfs filesystem references. adb-remount-test.sh has been at \u0027war\u0027 lately dealing with all the new APEX mount namespace activities and trying to filter them out for a clean presentation. But their \u0027overlay\u0027 references only exists _if_ adb remount uses it, so not an issue for this check of yours.\n\nKISS (or not?) maybe just check if system is clearly overridden? grep \"^overlayfs .* /system$\", maybe better to just grab the df output and use Java\u0027s own string management to check for existence?",
