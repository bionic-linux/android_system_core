      "message": "no, you just needed to know \"one simple trick\". sometimes you won\u0027t have *submit* permission. most commonly for changes to the manifest, but occasionally for stuff like like. the trick is to set autosubmit+1 because the machine does have the power. _sometimes_ you won\u0027t have permission to autosubmit+1, and then you really do need to find a human with magic powers. tavila and ipalant are often good places to start: they tend to have the powers or know who you _should_ be talking to. (though ideally (a) we\u0027d explain the problem in the interface and (b) have a more direct link to \"find me the human i need\". +samccone because we were just talking earlier today about the many ways in which gerrit\u0027s [mostly inherent, but still unfortunate] complexity makes it hard for people to do their jobs :-) )",
