      "message": "extended or extendable?\n\n(i think extendable is better than the perhaps more usual extensible because the latter sounds more general. you really do just \"mean you add your own stuff at the end\".)\n\nmaybe appendable, which isn\u0027t really a word, but might be the most intention-revealing word?\n\n\n\n\n...but i\u0027m not sure this comment really adds anything at all :-) if you want a comment, maybe talk about the ABI change? \"fn1 was deprecated and fn2 was added\"?",
