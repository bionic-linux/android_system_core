      "message": "not sure how this can happen. strlen(name) is verified in property_set, so it would mean than the snprintf to tempPath  filled it up, meaning that PERSISTENT_PROPERTY_DIR + sizeof(\".temp.XXXXXX\") \u003e\u003d PATH_MAX - PROP_NAME_MAX. . If you want to be that pedantic, check the length of snprintf to tempPath as well.",
