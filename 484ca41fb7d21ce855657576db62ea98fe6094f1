      "message": "not sure how this can happen. strlen(name) is verified in property_set, so it would mean than the snprintf to tempPath  filled it up, meaning that PERSISTENT_PROPERTY_DIR + sizeof(\".temp.XXXXXX\") \u003e\u003d PATH_MAX - PROP_NAME_MAX. . If you want to be that pedantic, check the length of snprintf to tempPath as well.",

But, I agree with you, it\u0027s useless futureproofing code.\n\nI changed line 351 and 352 (where the strlen is called) from an int to a size_t.  Otherwise, a strlen(name) \u003e 2G would have caused namelen to be negative, bypassing the PROP_NAME_MAX check. We accidentally detect this case on line 356.",
