It would be nice to have a comment somewhere explaining why errors are kind of ignored here.\n\nOne question on this particular test:\n\nIs it possible that if the other side has a full disk, that the CopyDone could succeed but the write could be truncated?\n\nWould it be better to still have this return a bool, but return the result of this call \u0026\u0026 CopyDone to guarantee that if there is a failure, it\u0027s marked as a failure?",
