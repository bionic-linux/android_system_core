Either on purpose, or by accident (!)\n\nWe could do std::string, but that would require more validity checking in fs_mgr_overlayfs_enabled() above, and largely unnecessary transitory allocation. This is (honestly, used to be as of 11am this morning, but not anymore, but who is to say what the future is with a library) called during First Stage init; I\u0027d prefer to keep allocations and boot delays at a minimum.",

Either on purpose, or by accident (!)\n\nEh, in practice they never can be.  The only places we alloc fstab_rec\u0027s in fs_mgr_fstab.cpp always set these.  We unapologetically skip the null checks in first_stage_mount and the rest of fs_mgr.  There\u0027s not really any graceful fall back if they were null either, so I\u0027m more than happy to just blow up - basically just a corollary  to the idea \"don\u0027t catch exceptions that you can\u0027t handle\"\n\nWe also rather unapologetically convert these to std::strings in first stage mount.  The allocation overhead is trivial compared to the rest of the operation.\n\nBowgo and I have stated that we want to rewrite this code about 100 times, but neither of us have found time.  If anyone\u0027s free to, replacing all of struct fstab with a class that just has a sane vector\u003cFstabEntry\u003e element, where FstabEntry is a class containing the fstab information as std::string\u0027s would be a very welcome change.",
