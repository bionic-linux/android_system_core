We could check `ro.product.build.version.sdk` and if it\u0027s newer than R then we reject loading the legacy paths?  \n\nIn retrospect, we should have used `ro.odm.build.version.sdk` for the ODM partition instead of coupling it with the vendor partition, though I think that\u0027s new enough to not make a difference.",

We don\u0027t expect the case where vendor and odm target different versions.\n\nFor the product partition, `ro.product.build.version.sdk` itself is a property in the prop file. So, it can\u0027t be used to decide which prop file to use. Perhaps we might want to examine the properties just after loading etc/build.prop and then if it has ro.product.build.version.sdk \u003e R we don\u0027t fallback to the legacy path.
