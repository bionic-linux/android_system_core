      "message": "selinux_status_updated() simply checks a sequence number in a read-only shared page mapped from the kernel by the  selinux_status_open() call to see if it has changed since the last call to selinux_status_updated().  So it is checking on every uevent but the check requires no system calls in the common case.  Implementation of selinux_status_updated() can be found in the corresponding change uploaded for external/libselinux with the same change-id since it is a dependency.\nselinux_status_open()/selinux_status_updated() will fall back to checking a NETLINK_SELINUX socket on older kernels that do not support /sys/fs/selinux/status, but that would only be true for Linux \u003c 2.6.37.",
