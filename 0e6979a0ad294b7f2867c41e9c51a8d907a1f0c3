      "message": "There are two parts - first I removed `atrace_set_debuggable` symbol that used to be a C symbol, but https://r.android.com/1581672 left it behind and turned into C++ symbol.\n\nSecond, I wanted to prevent this from happening to other symbols in these files. Specifically, there is `atrace_begin_body`/`atrace_end_body` that\u0027s not defined in the global scope (just inside `atrace_begin`). I was thinking about adding trace-private.h which could hold all of these hidden definitions, but figured just adding `__BEGIN_DECLS` block in `trace-*.cpp` would be a lighter change.\n\n.map.txt would help enforce this, but... this requires a full NDK API review (which I just went through for a different library)!",
