      "message": "Hi Elliott, thanks again for reviewing CLs of this topic. However looks like the kernel driver CL that creates this file node has been rejected by kernel reviewers (b/188777408#comment13). I\u0027m abandoning these CLs for now while studying another alternative solution, and will depend on the result to restore them.",
