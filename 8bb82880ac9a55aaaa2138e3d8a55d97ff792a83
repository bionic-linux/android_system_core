      "message": "From aosp/1948841, aosp/2025823, and aosp/1612831 it looks like we add a field to `tombstone.proto` which gets filled out in `tombstone_proto.cpp` in `engrave_tombstone_proto`.\n\nBut `engrave_tombstone_proto` never gets called during `adb shell am hang`. Should I be testing the ANR in a different way? Is there some other place I need add this info to in addition to the `engrave_tombstone_proto`?",
