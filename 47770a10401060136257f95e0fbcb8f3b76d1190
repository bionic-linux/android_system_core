      "message": "This option is useful only for devices that use the \"forcefdeorfbe\" mount option, which defaults to using FDE, but uses FBE if a special marker file is present on first boot. We created that option so we could dogfood FDE without switching everyone over to it at once. As far as I know the only devices that ever used it were the Nexus 5x and 6p; there is no reason for anyone else ever to have used it.",

(the point being that we ship fastboot alongside adb so regular users [well, okay, \"advanced users\"] can manually flash/wipe/etc. whereas if this is only needed for OS development, that\u0027s fine because that hasn\u0027t been supported for years already.)",
