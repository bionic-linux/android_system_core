      "message": "In https://android-review.googlesource.com/#/c/124320 the proposal there is to always make the klogd available, not just for userdebug and eng. get_bool_svelte should be a low_ram config only to meet this requirement.\n\nThe question is, do we _want_ klogd available in user builds, and not just a convenience during development? logs become much less accessible in user builds, and are only visible in their entirety in a bugreport. The bugreport resorts to dmesg and last_kmsg so there is no need for \u0027logcat -b kernel\u0027 to be extracted.\n\n@yong.yau: how badly do you want/need this in a user build?",
