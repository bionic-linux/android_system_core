      "message": "The commit message and the discussion in this bug alone indicates that this blueprint (bp) feature is now broken, it appears because there is a build scope issue. I will not dig deeper into the claims, accepting as ccross@\u0027s assessment we see in the discussion.\n\nAs I proposed and implemented this one feature in the hopes of removing content from the *.mk files and providing more power to bp files, finding out it\u0027s first and currently only example use is gone is what makes me sad. The ultimate goal should be to put everything into bp I was expecting; this used to be in Android.mk and now has moved into the build/ tree disconnecting and obfuscating even further the requirement that remount (and ultimately enable-verity and disable-verity) must never land on a \"user\" build.",
