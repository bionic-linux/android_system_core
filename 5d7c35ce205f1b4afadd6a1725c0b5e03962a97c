      "message": "This topic already removes the reference to libkeyutils from `vold`.  That leaves the reference in `system/extras/libfscrypt`, which is related and can be removed too (it\u0027s already been unnecessary since I296ce6d1272816c237e1ad213fbdef9f6fafb44f), the reference in `mini-keyctl` which is a command-line program, and the reference in `fsverity_init` which is something different.  `fsverity_init` is obsolete too and will be removed, but that\u0027s a different effort.  For `mini-keyctl` we\u0027d need to check what is using it before considering removing it.",
