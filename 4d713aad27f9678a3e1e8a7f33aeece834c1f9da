There\u0027s two issues:\n\n1-We do not need CAP_SETGID for this specific call to setgroups, because in line 245 we have not yet dropped caps.\n\n2-If the process expects to change UID/GIDs again (maybe to drop some GIDs, maybe to change UID to an even less privileged UID), the process should ask for CAP_SETUID/CAP_SETGID. Obviously CAP_SETUID/CAP_SETGID are very powerful capabilities, but note:\n\n\"3. If the effective user ID is changed from nonzero to 0, then the permitted set is copied  to the effective set.\"\n\nWhich means that asking for CAP_SETUID and changing the UID back to 0 won\u0027t allow the process to gain any extra caps: \"permitted\" is already the same as \"effective\" in the child process.\n\n(It also means that dropping caps while running as root is useful.)",
