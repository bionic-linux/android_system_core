      "message": "Yes, I understand that some services may have different settings for their cpuset and stune groups, but for app\u0027s case, if it is already in top-app, then changing its stune group can only lower its priority because top-app is the highest for now (I know there is \"rt\" group for stune, but it is not taking effect currently). And also we only have \"root\" and \"background\" group for blkio, so as long as the task\u0027s cpuset is not set to \"background\" group while it is in top-app, then it should be fine (this also applies for \"restricted\" group while screen off).",
