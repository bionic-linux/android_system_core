I have confirmed that build works, but I suspect it does because for those that do not include libutils, we are using the common headers (system/core/include) which is introducing technical debt.\n\nThe good news if this is not acceptable and we must drop these includes, is String8 has an operator to convert to char*, albeit more expensive than the direct implementation, works. String16 will break with a loud bang?",
