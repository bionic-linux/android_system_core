      "message": "This would read better as a helper function that can early return, and only set direct_read_ at the end on success.\n\nSince we safely fallback to non-direct reads, there\u0027s nothing in the tests that will fail if open(O_DIRECT) fails. We could be tricked into thinking it\u0027s working when it isn\u0027t.\n\nMaybe we could split direct_read into \"want_direct_read_\" and \"direct_read_\", and then in some of the centralized setup code in snapuserd_test, loop over each worker and ASSERT_EQ(worker-\u003edirect_read(), \u003cconfig-value\u003e)? (Or expose that in the handler or something).",
