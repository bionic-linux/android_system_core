      "message": "TBH no it\u0027s not important right now, since I don\u0027t think we have any commands that sends a lot of data from the device to the host. This just adds some future-proofing in case fastboot adds a command that does this later on.\n\nAs a comparison, when I implemented the device side in Python, the difference between keeping a list of buffers vs. appending to a single buffer as packets came in was enormous (\u003c10 seconds vs several minutes for downloading a partition). I haven\u0027t actually tried in C++ though, so those numbers may not apply here.\n\nIn any case I\u0027m happy to leave this out if you think it adds more complexity than it\u0027s worth and/or if there\u0027s no chance we\u0027re going to implement reading large amounts of data from a device.",
