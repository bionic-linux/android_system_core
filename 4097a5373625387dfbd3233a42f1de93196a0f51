(which, for optional features, means they\u0027re always bitrotted when you want them, and for cases like this that are dependent on build variant, means you\u0027ve introduced a new way for someone to break the build variant they didn\u0027t test with.)\n\n(i also hate global variables like auth_required, but the adb code isn\u0027t factored well enough for me to reasonably fix that...)",
