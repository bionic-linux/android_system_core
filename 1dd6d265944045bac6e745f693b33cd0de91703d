      "message": "this line in particular (which hasn\u0027t changed), or this change?\n\ntbh, i have no recollection of any of this. the bug bankruptcy bot was hassling me to do something or close the bug. so i thought i\u0027d kick off presubmit to see where we were. it looks like there was +2 and passed presubmit historically, so i was taking that as \"some kind of improvement, and probably all we\u0027re likely to get round to doing\".\n\n(though i would be interested as a followup to see whether i can disable this for darwin --- that\u0027s always a worthwhile saving.)",

      "message": "Ya sorry should have been more specific. I meant returning -1 here in the case of an error, which turns into SIZE_MAX. Returning zero seems more intuitive to me, but not all callers currently check for `\u003c\u003d 0`, so those that just check for `\u003c 0` would need fixups.\n\nFor example this file, which does the check both ways: https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/+/master:frameworks/base/core/jni/android_util_MemoryIntArray.cpp;l\u003d205",
