My understanding is that sys.powerctl is only written once during a reboot. \n\nThanks for the detailed explanation, Bart. I understand that we don\u0027t currently have such a case, but isn\u0027t the check [1] to assert that, so that if someone mistakenly breaks the assumption in the future we get an error?\n\nLet me invite Tom Cherry who wrote the code as I don\u0027t fully understand this part of init. Tom, please review this.\n\n[1] https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/+/master:system/core/init/init.cpp;drc\u003d68a59e1c720871277b01131edb3b64908ad03cbf;l\u003d282",
