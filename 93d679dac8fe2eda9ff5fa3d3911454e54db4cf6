      "message": "DebugRebootLogging() can only be called concurrently with CheckShutdown() if sys.powerctl is written twice. My understanding is that sys.powerctl is only written once during a reboot. The sequence is as follows:\n* /system/bin/reboot ... is executed.\n* The sys.powerctl property is set. See also https://source.corp.google.com/android-internal/system/core/reboot/reboot.c \n* property_set() is called.\n* __system_property_set() sends a PROP_MSG_SETPROP2 message.\n* /system/bin/reboot executes the following code:\n\n    // Don\u0027t return early. Give the reboot command time to take effect\n    // to avoid messing up scripts which do \"adb shell reboot \u0026\u0026 adb wait-for-device\"\n    if (cmd \u003d\u003d reboot) {\n        while (1) {\n            pause();\n        }\n    }\n\n* The init process received PROP_MSG_SETPROP2 (handle_property_set_fd()).\n* HandlePropertySet() is called.\n* DebugRebootLogging() is called.\n* PropertySet() is called.\n* NotifyPropertyChange() is called.\n* PropertyChanged() is called.\n* For name \u003d\u003d sys.powerctl, trigger_shutdown() is called.\n* ShutdownState::TriggerShutdown(value) is called.\n* shutdown_command_ and do_shutdown_ are set.\n* WakeMainInitThread() is called.\n* if property_triggers_enabled is true:\n* ActionManager::QueuePropertyChange(name, value) is called.\n* WakeMainInitThread() is called.\n* The main loop is woken up and CheckShutdown() is called.",
