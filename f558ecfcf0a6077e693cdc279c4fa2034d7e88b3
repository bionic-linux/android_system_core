It does take 200ms if a dm node goes away (which can only really happen with fastbootd). We could eliminate the theoretical impact if this code is disabled if running inside init for first_stage_init?\n\nYou should see the work I did for init to switch to inotify for wait_for_file etc, and to allow ueventd to set properties without deadlock. Those changes could be extended and used to help reduce the impact here too I expect?",
