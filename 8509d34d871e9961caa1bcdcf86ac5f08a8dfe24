I\u0027ll want to do a little more testing before I submit but before I did too much I wanted to check: Does this overall idea look good to folks? Anything I need to obviously change?\n\nI\u0027m fairly convinced that we should move to UUID-based bootdevice identification across the board even if it\u0027s really only a huge problem for USB devices today. \n\nI\u0027d especially love some feedback about what people think we should do if the bootloader provides both the old-style bootdevices and the new boot_part_uuid. Right now in this case the code throws a warning and then makes sure boot devices match both. That sounds like a nice \"extra secure\" feature but I don\u0027t think we really need it as talked about in the code. The sysfs paths are also a tad bit fragile across kernel uprevs and we can get away from that fragility by just moving everyone to UUID.\n\nHappy to meet if folks would rather talk over VC.",
