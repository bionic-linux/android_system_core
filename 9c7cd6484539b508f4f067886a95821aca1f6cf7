      "message": "yeah writing this in python might be a tad more simple (friendlier string, int, list type) I was thinking about rewriting this all from scratch previously, but this test is basically a bunch of adb commands glued together, rewriting in python would pretty much end up with similar code.",

      "message": "My experience with writing Java hostside tests are pretty bad TBH... the abstraction is weird and inconsistent, sometimes errors are thrown, sometimes errors are returned as exit code. IO related try-catch blocks are a nightmare to write, and adb-related abstractions are almost always related to IO.\n\nI\u0027m also traumatized by the constant 30s~2min *warm up* cost of `atest`. That\u0027s why I prefer python/bash/gtest. I\u0027d rather just do `subprocess.run([\u0027adb\u0027, ...])` than deal with Java *host* side test ðŸ˜‚",
