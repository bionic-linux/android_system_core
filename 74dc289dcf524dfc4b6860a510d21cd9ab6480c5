      "message": "Well, this only happens when on a system where\n\n 0. it\u0027s using A/B (e.g. slotselect present in fstab file)\n 1. the bootloader isn\u0027t passing slot_suffix on the cmdline; and\n 2. the misc partition isn\u0027t set up correctly.\n\nso chances are it\u0027s only happening on developer systems, not production devices.\n\nThe reason I want this behavior is to avoid a flag day for all the Brillo developers. IOW, I want to add slotselect to our fstab file but I do not want to break already deployed devices that are not yet repartitioned for A/B (these devices only have \u0027boot\u0027 and \u0027system\u0027 partitions).\n\nIf I error out instead of this behavior, I\u0027ll instantly break all these devices (because we can\u0027t mount /system) and force developers to run my repartitioning script. This is not a good use of their time, I think.\n\nOn the other hand, with this change, their systems continue to work and they can repartition when they need A/B.\n\nI agree that an error is more appropriate and I don\u0027t mind changing it to that in a couple of months... it\u0027s just a lot more practical for us this way. Thanks for considering.",
