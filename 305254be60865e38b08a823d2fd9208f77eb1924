It seems that (at least my reading of) POSIX says that pthread_mutex_trylock has defined behavior in this case, so we can probably get away with it here?\n\n(Also noticed in reading the spec that destroying a mutex while it\u0027s held is UB, so fixed that.)",

So do you want to be on the hook for that in the future?, or just comment out that portion of the test. You guys are maintaining the code, so it\u0027s your call.",
