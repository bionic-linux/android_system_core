      "message": "I would still need to comment for this one even if I moved it below because we want to reserve errno for return. Besides, best practices are to free resources and unlock before calling any logging routines.\n\nWe _know_ that PLOG preserved errno for _return_ as well. But I wanted to make sure no one wastes time like I did confirming that freecon does not upset errno in order to evaluate if it must be saved and restored before _return_.",
