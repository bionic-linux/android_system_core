It is set explicitly to 0 on my user build shamu, but idk if that\u0027s reliable for all devices.\n\nThere\u0027s also dev.bootcomplete, but that has the same issues.\n\nI suppose we can say for sure that init.svc.adbd will be set to running, as none of these tests will be valid without adbd being up.",
