      "message": "IMO this doesn\u0027t contribute much regarding the new behavior. And, because there is only one test in the list, we can\u0027t verify `StopServicesFromApex` stops only services from target apex.\n\nI think we need at least four services:\n- a normal service (not from any apex)\n- two services from the target apex\n- a service from other apex\n\nAnd starting them all here. And verifying that only services from the target apex are stopped.\n\nThen we can verify that\n- StopServicesFromApex doesn\u0027t accidentally stop other services (normal service or services from other apexes)\n- StopServicesFromApex supports multiple services from the target apex.\n\nYou can have smaller/focused/parameterized tests instead of a big test.",
