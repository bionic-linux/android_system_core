      "message": "Hi Elliott, this is primarily a \"question CL\" (code says more than just words).\n\nSo, android::Vector defines operator\u003d const, which as I understand is not supposed to modify the object (btw, how does it make sense for assignment operator?). But we use it to call VectorImpl::operator\u003d which doesn\u0027t have const variant (so really we should cast this to non-const). Is there something I\u0027m missing?\n\nIf there is not, then proposed change at least makes it clear we\u0027re modifying a const object here.",
