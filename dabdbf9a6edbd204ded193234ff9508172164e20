Seeing as random makefile cleanup seems to be my current calling I shall no doubt take a look. We\u0027re also only a couple of commits away from killing libunz too.",

My \"random makefile cleanup\" plan for now is to kill libunz ( about 4 more small commits )  and cleanup the rest of system/core as I have been doing..( about 6 more small commits ) . \n\nBut like you say if I get the urge to kill so variable I run that by you first.
