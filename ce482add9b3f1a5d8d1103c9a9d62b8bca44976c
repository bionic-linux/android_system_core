      "message": "We would have to use mmap interface to work backwards with any efficiency. mmap has its readability/maintenance options.\n\nWe are not assuming the log entries are in time order (!) although 99.99% of the time they are.\n\nlogcat is a user program with no need for tons of optimizations; I have found this rips through 16MB of data (as configured for logcatd) in less than 200ms. The optimization does not appear to be required on the scale we use in Android.\n\nIn all common cases we hit the basename file _first_ (because of how the rotate algorithm works) and break out below very quickly; so we are not pouring through all the files in any case. We only do so if there are no timestamps found in the basename file which can only happen if logcatd dies or the system reboots.",
