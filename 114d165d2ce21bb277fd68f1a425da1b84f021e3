      "message": "I\u0027m not really fond of this change. It feels like a band-aid to make things kind of work.\n\nI wrote a slightly different unwinder for local unwinds that will reparse the maps when it can\u0027t find a map for a pc. See LocalUnwinder::GetMapInfo. I think it would be better to create an unwinder like this than try and guess why the unwind failed.",
