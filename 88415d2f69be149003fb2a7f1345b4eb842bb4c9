      "message": "I spent a pile of time trying to figure out if there are any cases where this function is called to wait for partitions that _aren\u0027t_ on the boot device and I didn\u0027t come up with an amazing conclusion. There are a whole lot of calls to `block_dev_init_.InitDevices()` (some of which are indirectly from `FirstStageMountVBootV2::InitRequiredDevices()`) handling special corner cases that I\u0027m not that familiar with.\n\nIn the end I figured that since we\u0027re only enforcing this for new devices (those using `boot_part_uuid` that this was at least safe enough. If someone points out some case where we need to use this function to wait for something that _isn\u0027t_ on the \"boot devices\" then we could always add some type of boolean variable here.\n\nIf folks who know this code better than I do think this is wrong then please let me know! I just wanted to call it to attention (and document it!) since I was less certain about it than I wanted to be.\n\nThanks!",
