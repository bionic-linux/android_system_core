      "message": "Is this actually \"if device is USB, disconnect and let device polling automatically reconnect. Otherwise, if TCP, just disconnect\"?\n\nFWIW, when I was debugging Windows USB issues, I overloaded adb disconnect to be able to disconnect USB devices (and then let the device polling automatically reconnect). I never checked-in that change since it was just for debugging. The benefit was that I didn\u0027t have to add a new host:reconnect command. I don\u0027t know if this is a better route than what you\u0027ve got.",
