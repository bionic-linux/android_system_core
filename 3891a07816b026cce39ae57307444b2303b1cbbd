      "message": "I\u0027m not super comfortable with \"advanced\" OWNERS syntax, but this could work:\n\n`file:\u003cpath/to/common\u003e:main:\u003cpath/to/OWNERS\u003e`\n\nBased on my read of [this](https://android-review.googlesource.com/plugins/code-owners/Documentation/backend-find-owners.html#syntax), the file syntax only works if both projects are checked out. So I think we have to assume they\u0027re always in a repo together?\n\nFrankly, I dunno if all that is correct or not. If you want to go extra cred it here and get fancy, go for it ðŸ˜Š I\u0027m a bit nervous that if I tried this I\u0027d just hose your OWNERS setup and have trusty devs upset with me, so my inclination is to not get fancy in any change I author for another team\u0027s OWNERS file.",
