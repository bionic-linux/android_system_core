      "message": "i think this should probably be [ \u003cflag\u003e ]* [ \u003coptions\u003e ] (i.e. missing the last * so we don\u0027t imply that options has to end with a trailing \u0027,\u0027).\n\nthis is pretty confusing, though, because both the man page and /etc/fstab refer to both of these as options, and include them all in the same string. even init\u0027s mount_all command requires fstabs where they\u0027re all mixed together.\n\ni\u0027ll raise a bug to rewrite \u0027mount\u0027 using \u0027mount_all\u0027. then we can fix the documentation to just \"mount \u003ctype\u003e \u003cdevice\u003e \u003cdir\u003e [\u003coptions\u003e]\", and we can have a compatibility mode that concatenates anything after \u003cdir\u003e. (i\u0027d rather just fix the init scripts, but i can only fix Nexus ones and i assume this would be a pain in the ass for OEMs because there\u0027s no way for me to communicate a breaking change.)",
