      "message": "Statement of Intent:\n\nThis CL was formerly part of the svelte patch but was deemed as too much in one CL. I was being risk averse with zero real code refactors so that I could get these two into maintenance release. Was fixing an annoying overlapping problem with a new warning message (compiler only noticed it as disjoint part of the svelte CL) and dgram_qlen_statistics not matching the naming convention before we could apply the following svelte-inspired CL.\n\nI will run this through a full retest the refactor and update once it has passed.",
