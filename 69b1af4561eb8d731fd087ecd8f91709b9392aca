I\u0027m wondering if it may be worth keeping a map of the DM sysfs node -\u003e these new symlinks.  It wouldn\u0027t cost much memory, yet it\u0027d be much cleaner to have ueventd able to handle both creating and deleting these symlinks.  It\u0027d remove the chances of there being stale symlinks, which alone is likely worth it.",
