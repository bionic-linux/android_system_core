      "message": "this is too big, and logd is marked unkillable by OOMs.  Setting this from developer settings is likely to run the system out of memory with no recourse and cause a panic.  On the next boot, the persist property will still be there, and it will do it again.\n\nThe max is going to either need to be very small, or need to be adaptive so it doesn\u0027t cause problems on svelte devices.",

      "message": "It seems strange to call setsize multiple times, somebody might modify setsize to do immediate preallocation or truncation in the future, and I don\u0027t see how this doesn\u0027t always end up using the second size.  Check if the highest priority property is set, if so use it, otherwise try the lower priority property.",
