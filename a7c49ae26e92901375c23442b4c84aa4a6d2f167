In which case yes, makes sense to change the owner and make the perms 600.\n\nAlthough somehow if we do that it feels like maybe prng_seeder is the wrong name.  But I guess if we get other use cases down the road we can introduce a new group ownership.",

(though i\u0027m really not sure how much it matters at all, given the selinux label? +jeffv in case his view is just \"meh, root:root everything is fine\".)",
