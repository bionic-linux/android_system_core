      "message": "No, brillo\u0027s crash_reporter no longer uses /run.  None of our services use a shared /run directory anymore (which doesn\u0027t exist on Android\u0027s FS).  When we asked earlier whether Android had anything equivalent to /run, we were told there wasn\u0027t since it would be a possible security vector for malicious apps to read and modify other system process\u0027s data.  So everything was moved to within /data/misc/\u003cservice\u003e folders.  Right now, I think the kernel-crash-detected is the only part that crash_reporter is putting in this generic run folder... all other functionality I put into one of the other tmp/log/lock/crash folders that I\u0027m creating below.",
