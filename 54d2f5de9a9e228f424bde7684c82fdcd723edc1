Seems more like it would be LOG(INFO) since presumably it\u0027s intentional that there are skipped entries.\n\nBack to the original bug, the fact that they\u0027re using status\u003ddisabled isn\u0027t even strictly required.  Their use case should work if there is simply no DT fstab but this code would still fail it with a LOG(FATAL).\n\nPerhaps we just drop this whole line to LOG(INFO) regardless of if there are skipped DT entries?  It was useful as FATAL while we were first starting off with first stage mount, but at this point perhaps it\u0027s causing more harm than good.  It should be super obvious to developers during bring up if their system isn\u0027t booting since all of its partitions are not mounted now anyway.",
