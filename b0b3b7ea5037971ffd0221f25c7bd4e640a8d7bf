      "message": "I did that deliberately, the pageflags should have been the 3rd argument anyway and the mask default can be equalt to the page flags themselves (which is almost always the case). The whole pm_process_usage_flags is going away on the account of libmeminfo. In fact, this usage itself is busted right now and am not sure anybody uses it even in procrank.\n\nI kept it to not break compatibility, likely, we will be deprecating this.",
