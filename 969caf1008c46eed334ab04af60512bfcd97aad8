      "message": "This is only releasing one refcount of ownership. Maybe \u0027releaseOne\u0027 or similar? Or document more. In the commit message, you say instead of running ~sp. Of course, it\u0027s unsafe in generaly to call \u0027delete ret\u0027. You must call \u0027ret-\u003edecStrong()\u0027 because there may be something else that owns it. Or were you thinking something else?\n\nDo you have the case where you want to use this, so I can see what you mean? I can see how this API would be useful, but it\u0027s also probably better to avoid managing ownership like this.",
