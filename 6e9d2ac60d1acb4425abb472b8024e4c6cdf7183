      "message": "Same thoughts as on the GetVar CL; these seem better in flashing.cpp and not in FastbootDevice.  They don\u0027t depend on any internal state to FastbootDevice and it seems better to me to keep this class strictly for dispatching the USB commands and handling object lifetime.\n\nThe PartitionHandle class could then be moved to flashing.h, which seems like a much more appropriate place for it.",
