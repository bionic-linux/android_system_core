      "message": "Hi David,\n\nRegarding the KeyMint RoT issue on cuttlefish, I would like to add a new binary to set the required data. Since anyway we don\u0027t have a valid DICE chain in VM on cuttlefish, it doesn\u0027t matter much if the RoT is also fake.\n\nThere are no changes on the existing host binary.\n\nWDYT?",
