      "message": "Yeah, I think it was falling through. The released adb doesn\u0027t even check the error from GetTempPath(), so this is a little bit better, but yeah the fall-through is a little scary. I think in practice that GetTempPath() never really fails. I think it is the least of our practical worries. :)",
