Though I think in practice they are unlikely to overlap since adb_open() fds start at 100 and CRT fds start at zero and adb probably doesn\u0027t have maybe fds open via the CRT.",

      "message": "It doesn\u0027t really matter to me. Here\u0027s what I think of all the APIs (with open as an example):\n\n- _open() seems to be a Microsoft thing since open() is technically non-standard from the MS perspective (since they\u0027re not really POSIX). So if I see _open(), that makes me think the code is Windows-only.\n\n- open() is POSIX, but also available on Windows unless you #define __STD__ or something. Then adb does #define open __xxx_unix_open to remind people to explicitly call either unix_open or adb_open.\n\n- unix_open() really means \"call OS/CRT open instead of an abstraction above the OS like sysdeps\". If this test code were really part of adb, I think I\u0027d expect this code to call unix_open().\n\nSo, to fit the rest of the adb code, I guess unix_open/unix_close/unlink/pipe makes more sense, but it doesn\u0027t really matter to me one way or another.",

I\u0027ll change it on Monday and re-upload.\n\nHmm actually in that case do you think adb_isatty() should be unix_isatty() instead?
