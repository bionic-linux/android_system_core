      "message": "We\u0027d need to get rid of this code if we did the above mechanism, since times won\u0027t be monotonically increasing if we insert the element into the log based on its realtime time stamp.\n\nI\u0027m not sure that changing it to monotonic helps either, since we don\u0027t sort within the \u0027region lock\u0027 and that may create out of order entries, which is also going to cause big problems.\n\nTruthfully, I think we need to get rid of this code in general and make the users responsible for the sorting.",
