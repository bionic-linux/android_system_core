      "message": "Should call getpwname(\"system\")-\u003egr_uid to be \"correct\" and eliminate the dependency on proiate/android_filesystem_config.h. But we may need to cache the results to prevent a latency impact.\n\nMaybe even search for /dev/memcg/\u003cpw_name\u003e/ directory entries to eliminate them\n(except apps) should other uid-names be landed in the future and allow them to be handled automagically? Doing so may be used as an exploit, an application writing to /dev/memcg/ could create its own (or rather protected) memory cgroup, and that may be undesirable?",
