      "message": "Taking a look at the code in drivers/usb/core/file.c, function usb_register_dev, my understanding is that there should always be a name for any usbmisc device.\n\nSince I was not sure about this before, the patch adopted a conservative approach.\n\nDo you want me to make a v2 in which I separate usb and usbmisc management removing that logic for usbmisc?",

      "message": "Makes sense that it has a name.  Understood about the conservative approach, but I\u0027d rather we only implement the code paths we know we will use for and add others later if it turns out they\u0027re needed.\n\nDo the below two changes work for you:\n\nhttps://android-review.googlesource.com/460476 ueventd: check subsystems list before doing usb subsystem logic        \nhttps://android-review.googlesource.com/460477 ueventd: add usbmisc subsystem  \n\nIf so, I think they\u0027ll be better as we\u0027ll hardcode less of these subsystems.\n\nAlternatively/if not then yes, please make a v2.  You can just upload a new patchset to this change.",
