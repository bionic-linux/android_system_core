      "message": "We did not want to add to setcon() since that\u0027s a generic implementation.  There is selinux_android_setcontext() that I am also adding this to, but it only deals with apps so it doesn\u0027t apply here and we thought to handle this one special case separately.\n\n@nnk is the best to comment if we should create an android_setcon() to prevent having to do this.  I would agree with that.",
