      "message": "Initially I tried integrating with the base native_handle code in libcutils, but the need to depend on bionic to pull in fdsan.h was not trivial due to its widespread usage (e.g. even when scoped to target: android in Android.bp, a bunch of issues with usage in APEX modules popped up), so I went this route instead. If you know of a straightforward way to merge this back into native_handle.h/.cpp, let me know.",
