      "message": "Agreed, see my earlier comment. In short, it seems rather difficult to depend on bionic headers from libcutils, because libcutils is so widely used. I tried a few different ways, the most promising of which was to wrap code with `#ifdef __BIONIC__` and put the libasync_safe dependency within only bionic targets in the .bp (i.e. linux_bionic \u0026 android), but I ran into a bunch of build errors around APEX visibility of libasync_safe (which seemed to be the most minimal way to mark a dependency on fdsan, but maybe there\u0027s another way). Open to suggestions, as ideally this would just live in the existing native_handle.h/.cpp files...",
