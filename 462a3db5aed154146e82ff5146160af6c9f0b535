      "message": "Because he has no class ;-\u003e\n\nandroid_logcat::system() method added for completeness only, but it has no use for the context, and the code as-is in logcat_test.cpp skirted this by not doing logcat_define(ctx) whenever logcat_system was the sole representative. I would need to _add_ the definitions, and modify logcat_system() to take a context argument.\n\nI could \u0027solve\u0027 this by making the system() static, and the calls as android_logcat::system(). But doing so would require us to define it somewhere, as in within liblogcat, which breaks the inline (as in requires no C++ ABI from liblogcat) nature of this class.\n\nMaybe should get some C++ expert eyes on this?",
