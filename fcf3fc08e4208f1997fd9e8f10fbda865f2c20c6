      "message": "Hi Steven,\n\nDo you think there\u0027s any chance that the shared_ptr use in the \"before\" code might cause the ASAN report in the attached bug?\n\nFrom aosp/1235494 it seems that the \"after\" code is the preferred way of doing things (although interestingly, making SharedRefBase::operator new private doesn\u0027t seem to prevent use of make_shared\u003cT\u003e, because it uses ::new())\n\nThanks!",
