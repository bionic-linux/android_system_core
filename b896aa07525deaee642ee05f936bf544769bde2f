      "message": "what is the purpose of this class? It seems to only support a dedicated thread with two functions to handle the current events. Why are these function pointers and not a pure virtual member function? Every time we add a metric type are we expected to pass a new function pointer in? Also we really need the app that uses this interface to be multithreaded, or can we have a single threaded app that uses epoll (or select/poll) to handle all its communication?",
