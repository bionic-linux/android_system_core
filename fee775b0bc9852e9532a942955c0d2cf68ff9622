I like this, but would still think that having the first 32bits in 0x08x format is going to be easier to decode as it usually includes the command.",

      "message": "I\u0027ve added logic to format additional context into the trace event name. The one thing I wasn\u0027t sure about including is the the file descriptor `fd` in `tipc_connect`. The reason for this is because the final value for `fd` isn\u0027t determined until the end of the function, but we want to call `ATRACE_BEGIN` at the beginning of the function. I think we *could* wait until after `fd` has been given its final value before calling `ATRACE_BEGIN`, but that would mean that we call `ATRACE_END` right after it, resulting in a slice with close to 0 time captured in it.\n\nA maybe more appropriate way of capturing the value of `fd` for debugging might be to log it and then have Perfetto [capture the log](https://perfetto.dev/docs/data-sources/android-log). Perfetto seems to have support for displaying what logs were emitted during a particular slice, so in theory you\u0027d be able to select the `tipc_connect` slice and find the log that includes `fd` pretty easily. I\u0027ll try to create a prototype of this to see how well it shows up in the UI.",
