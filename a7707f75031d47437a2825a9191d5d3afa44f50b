      "message": "Why call reset here?  It you have `\u003d 0` in the initializer and you\u0027re constructing a new Modprobe instance in each loop.  I don\u0027t think you\u0027re increasing the module count in the constructor either, right?\n\nNot super important, but just seems like a bit of an anti-pattern if you always need to reset the module count right after constructing the object.",
