      "message": "Overall, how many of the functions in this file or writer.h form a public API for the lib?  It seems that many, including all of the functions exposed only for testing could be local includes in fs_mgr/liblp/ directly.  The test and other files in the library would still be able to reference them, but it\u0027d keep the public interface cleaner.\n\nProbably not relevant for this CL, but maybe something for another CL?",
