      "message": "It looks like this use of a default argument in a header that\u0027s trying to be C compatible breaks the C compatibility.\n\nI just ran into this with some partner code.  I\u0027ve put up a follow up CL (https://android-review.googlesource.com/c/platform/system/core/+/1402255 ) to address this.  I don\u0027t think it\u0027s perfect, but it seems better than what we have now from a C perspective.",
