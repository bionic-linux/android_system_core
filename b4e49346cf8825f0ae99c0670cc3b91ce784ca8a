      "message": "What is your overall use case?  Do you need this behavior anywhere outside of testing?  That\u0027s the only place where I see logging is restored now.\n\nThe worry here is that this function is explicitly not thread safe, which is a conscious decision, since (number of processes that will change from the default logger) \u003e\u003e (number of processes that will change the logger only once at start up) \u003e\u003e (number of processes that will change the logger multiple times).  I wouldn\u0027t want to encourage people to use this API multiple times in their program, especially if it is multi-threaded.  ",

      "message": "My use case is implementing google3\u0027s ScopedMockLog in Android. That object redirects logs to a mock function and lets you add GMock expectations for log messages, but stops doing it when destroyed, so I would put a call to __android_log_set_logger(nullptr) in the destructor. Without this change, I would need to put #ifdef __ANDROID__ there. Hardcoding the choice of default logger everywhere doesn\u0027t seem like the best idea to me.",

      "message": "Would you be okay if we did this in libbase instead of liblog?  We have a lot more freedom with that API since it isn\u0027t in the NDK.  We could even think about having android::base::SetLogger() return the previous logger so that ScopedMockLog would switch back to the previous logger and not the default one.  android::base::SetLogger() is implemented on top of __android_log_set_logger(), so it\u0027d impact all logs, just avoid the ABI issues.\n\nAre you okay with this not being thread safe?  That\u0027s my one other concern.  I don\u0027t think the overhead of thread safety is worth adding this in a thread safe manner.",
