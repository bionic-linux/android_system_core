      "message": "a few general notes on compression:\n- brotli is very efficient for APKs, but it never been design for high compression throughput. lz4 is much faster and requires less resources to compress,\n- already compressed entries (e.g. with LZMA) might become bigger as a result of re-compression. makes sense to detect and send the original data instead,\n- there is a way to detect uncompressible chunks without running through compression - e.g. read each sixteenth byte and try to evaluate randomness. if you are interested I can try to dig  up a code snippet doing that",
