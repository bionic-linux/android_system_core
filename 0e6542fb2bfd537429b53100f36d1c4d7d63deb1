      "message": "+jeffv@ about using ReadFileToString() instead of ReadFile() - in 2012, nnk@ added ReadFile() which rejects files that are group or world writable, to prevent init reading in any files that a user could have modified.  wvw@\u0027s use case however requires reading in /dev/cpuctl/tasks, which is world readable.  Do you have any comments here?\n\nThis does relax a restriction in init, though not significantly, since `exec cp /world/readable/file /somewhere/else` was always possible.",
