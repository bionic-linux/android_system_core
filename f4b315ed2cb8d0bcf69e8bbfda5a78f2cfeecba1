Can we just remove the dependencies on libutils instead?\n\nIf this class just depended on stdlib classes instead of String8/Vector, we wouldn\u0027t have this problem. Plus, those types are deprecated, so I\u0027d rather not introduce a hack like this for using them here.",

      "message": "I strongly agree with the sentiment, and David Sehr and I discussed this. A small part of that discussion is captured in b/79112958. A problem is that we inherently need libziparchive, which relies heavily on libutils. The backtrace mechanism has to be able to access dexfiles, and that tooling in general still relies on libutils. I think it would take a major rewrite to avoid this. Not that that\u0027s a bad idea, but ...",
