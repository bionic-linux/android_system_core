      "message": "Just to state it again in the context of this new CL:\n\nI would like to see C++ headers broken into a set that have no library dependencies, and a set that have a dependency on the libutils.so. Splitting them can be outside the scope of this CL, but I can at least state that libutils ByteOrder.h, Endian.h and FastStrcmp.h are some of the pure header-only files. So see if you can imagine the appropriate build mechanics to separate/overlap them maybe?\n\nThe VNDK can be served by having this split. but we probably can never guarantee that a header-only library will not become ABI-dependent in the future?",
