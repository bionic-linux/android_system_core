That one uses pc - load_bias.\n\nMy understanding is: the start address of a function in FDE can be encoded in more than one way. For example, in my environment, generic_arm64/symbols/system/lib/libbase.so has FDE entries of debug_frame encoded in 0x00, and generic_arm64/symbols/system/lib64/libbase.so has FDE entries of debug_frame encoded in 0x1b. If encoded in 0x00, then using pc is correct; If encoded in 0x1b, then using pc - load_bias is correct.\n\nCan you verify if my idea is wrong? I think at least we should add testcases for both encodings.",
