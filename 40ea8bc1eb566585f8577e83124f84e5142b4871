      "message": "BoringSSL provides a bssl::UniquePtr\u003cT\u003e nowadays. I would have switched this file to it, but it was C. :-) We are stuck with the various takes-ownership-only-on-success APIs for OpenSSL compatibility, so it\u0027s still a little annoying, but ah well. At some point I need to write new RSA creation functions because the setters they wrote are truly atrocious.\n\nThis is probably a really dumb question (I don\u0027t Android much), but how do I tell which test is timing out? I see \"TIMEOUT: The test is cancelled after timeout.\", but I can\u0027t find the button to view details.",
