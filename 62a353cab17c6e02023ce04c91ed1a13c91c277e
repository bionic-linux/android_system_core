      "message": "NB: This change is not strictly needed this \u0027pass\u0027, it benefits the following cases:\n\n1) an optimization that guarantees one entry for identical set of keys (simulates std::set behavior but in a simpler std::vector class) but is a can-not-happen (academic at best).\n2) ensures that a negative value for timeout in following CL is first and easy to find (future proofing).\n3) places a (soft) restriction that all other composers (gTest in future CL) should also be in sorted order, when this is ultimately a Keychord class requirement and a imposition on callers.\n\nAs noted in a previous (unanswered) comment, maybe parsing/validation/sorting should be part of the Keycord\u0027s class?",
