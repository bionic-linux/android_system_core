      "message": "The problem with using info.dwSize.Y, is that it includes the scroll-back buffer (which everyone has enabled) which doesn\u0027t make sense to use in the logical window size. So I left it using info.srWindow. This is largely academic since no one runs full-screen programs with adb shell on Windows.\n\nI made the change to use info.dwSize.X, though I think that is largely theoretical since I don\u0027t think anyone runs a console window with the buffer wider than the window. But a good change to make to handle this pathological case.",

      "message": "\u003e I don\u0027t think anyone runs a console window with the buffer wider than the window\n\nI noticed this first when increasing the size of the buffer through properties, which doesn\u0027t automatically increase the window size. The width of the window would get reported instead of the buffer size, and then resizing the window wouldn\u0027t get noticed, since the buffer size didn\u0027t change.\n\n(I\u0027m not sure how many people are on pre-Win10, where this matters a lot more, but I\u0027d bet it\u0027s pretty sizable.)",
