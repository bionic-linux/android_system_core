      "message": "The rules apply on first match, meaning more specific entries should come first. Look at note on 67-70. Confirmed that 84 and 85 are correctly setup on boot because of init runtime tidbits like this:\n\ninit.aosp.rc: mkdir /data/misc/shared_relro 0771 shared_relro shared_relro\ninit.rc: mkdir /data/misc/shared_relro 0771 shared_relro shared_relro\n\nI deleted directories on the target and manually created them in out/, ran adb push and sync before and after this CL and the directories in /data/misc were owned by root. Across the board when pushing content to data! Works fine to /system (remount) We may have a problem(tm) with adb file perms on /data via adb (unrelated to this). I need to see what happened on legacy releases in this regard.",
