      "message": "It\u0027s a little unwieldy to have both uid() and uid_ exposed, and it\u0027d be the only member exposed that way. At least in one iteration of the style guide, if not the current one, that\u0027s not recommended.\n\nSince most callers just want the uid-or-zero, I\u0027d add a second boolean, something like \"has_uid\" or \"specified_uid\". It\u0027ll make this patch significantly smaller too.",
