      "message": "NB: Do not move this logic into FlushCommand, we are tempted to use its two-pass logic for -t/-T # (count) rather than doing a pre-pass here and punting to the single-pass logic. The advantage as-is we hold the reader lock here, then release it, whereas tail count holds the reader lock for both passes in FlushCommand to enforce tail count accurately, so there may be a small latency performance advantage splitting it here.",
