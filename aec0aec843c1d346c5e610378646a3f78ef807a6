      "message": "This works well for incrementally adding worker support, but it seems like it could benefit from some encapsulation. Eg a \"Worker\" object that owns these fields, and gets passed around as needed. This would save having to fetch the tid all the time (admittedly not a big deal), but it would also make it clear which methods are doing \"worker stuff\", which could be a big readability win. It also might let you encapsulate some logic directly in the Worker class.\n\nNot necessarily needed for this CL... thoughts?",
